        <h2>The Vicious Cycle: How Avoidance Reinforces Itself and Increases Damage</h2>

        <p>Disorganized avoidant individuals often find themselves trapped in a <strong>vicious cycle</strong> that perpetuates their suffering and insecurity. The very strategies they use to protect themselves (avoidance, emotional walls, sabotaging intimacy) end up <strong>reinforcing the wounds</strong> that caused those strategies in the first place. Over time, this cycle can escalate, leading to more loneliness, more distrust, and more internal damage.</p>

                <p>Here's how the cycle typically plays out:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Fear of Intimacy → Avoidant Behavior:</strong> The person feels afraid of getting hurt or rejected, so they deploy an avoidant behavior (e.g., they pull away emotionally, lie, or end the relationship).</li>
                    <li><strong>Consequence → Loss or Unfulfilling Relationship:</strong> This behavior leads to negative consequences – perhaps their partner grows distant in response, confronts them, or the relationship ends outright. Similarly, with friends, their absence causes friendships to fade. Essentially, the avoidance leads to the very outcome they fear: <em>disconnection</em>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outcome Feeds Core Beliefs:</strong> The disorganized person experiences the breakup, friendship loss, or increased conflict as confirmation of their core beliefs: <em>"I knew they would leave"</em> or <em>"I'm not meant to be loved"</em> or <em>"People always hurt me"</em>. Even though their own actions contributed, they often <em>feel</em> like a victim of inevitable fate, because that fits their longstanding narrative of abandonment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Shame and Fear:</strong> Each failed relationship or hurtful episode adds to their pile of shame and fear. They might think, <em>"See, I ruin everything"</em> or <em>"Every time I trust someone, it blows up"</em>. This makes them <em>even more cautious and avoidant the next time</em> around, believing they have to protect themselves more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> With heightened defenses and pessimism, they enter the next relationship or social situation already guarded or picking someone likely to repeat the pattern – and the cycle continues.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Looking back, this cycle seems to explain so much of what happened between us, Nade. When we moved into the cottage and started getting really close, things were perfect for that first month. But as soon as that deep intimacy started to feel real, it felt like something shifted. You started seeing Ian again in November, the same client you'd slept with before. It felt like a way to create distance, maybe subconsciously, because the closeness was becoming too much (Fear of Intimacy → Avoidant Behavior). This led to constant fights, eroded trust, and immense pain for both of us (Consequence → Loss). Instead of addressing the real issue – the fear and the betrayal – you deflected, blaming my reactions or the situation, making me feel like the problem (Outcome Feeds Core Beliefs). The more this happened, the more you likely felt trapped or guilty, pushing you further away and reinforcing the belief that relationships end in pain (Increased Shame and Fear). This pattern repeated itself throughout the year, especially when we tried to reconcile or rebuild (Repeat).</p>

        <h3>The Negative Reinforcement Loop</h3>

        <p>In short, <strong>avoidance breeds more avoidance</strong>. Psychologically, avoidance is a <em>negative reinforcement loop</em>: when you avoid something scary (like emotional vulnerability), you feel immediate relief – which teaches you to avoid again next time. But you never learn that maybe the thing <em>wouldn't</em> have harmed you.</p>

                <p>In anxiety treatment, it's well-known that <em>"the immediate reduction in anxiety following avoidance reinforces avoidance behavior; it does not allow the individual the opportunity to learn that the feared consequence might not happen"</em><sup>1</sup>.</p>

                <p>In an attachment context, when a fearful-avoidant bails on a partner and feels relief ("phew, no one can hurt me now"), they <em>never stick around long enough to learn</em> that maybe that partner <em>would not</em> have hurt them and intimacy could be safe. Thus, their fear remains or even grows. They carry the unresolved trauma forward, often blaming themselves or others, but not breaking the pattern.</p>

                <p>Consider how one person described <em>"going in circles"</em> with partners who affirmed her negative self-view: <em>"You'll go in circles with this person, constantly ask yourself 'Why am I never good enough?'… And the cycle repeats."</em><sup>2</sup> She further noted that until she healed her deep abandonment wound, <em>"the only people in your life will just be a walking affirmation that says 'You are not worth it.'"</em><sup>3</sup></p>

                <p>This feels very true for us. Every time you chose to avoid a difficult conversation, or lied about seeing Ian or borrowing money from him, or went to Erica's place instead of talking to me, it probably felt easier in that moment. You avoided the confrontation, the vulnerability, the potential fight (temporary relief). But each avoidance built a bigger wall between us. You never gave us the chance to work through the issue, to see if maybe I *would* understand, or if we *could* find a compromise. Instead, the avoidance just confirmed your pattern: problems get avoided, trust gets broken, and eventually, the relationship feels too damaged, reinforcing the idea that intimacy leads to pain. You never learned that facing the fear together could have actually made us stronger.</p>

        <h3>The Escalating Internal Damage</h3>

        <p>The <strong>internal damage</strong> accumulates in several ways. Repeated tumultuous relationships can lead to chronic anxiety, depression, and even symptoms of PTSD. The person might become numb or extremely cynical about relationships ("love just isn't for me," "all people leave").</p>

                <p>They may also develop unhealthy coping habits – substance abuse, self-harm, risky behavior – to soothe the constant emotional turmoil. Each time they hurt someone they care about, they also hurt themselves; guilt and regret pile up, which can erode their self-esteem further.</p>

                <p>One fearful-avoidant described it as feeling <em>"terminally broken… like our inner world will never make sense"</em><sup>1</sup>, and <em>"it feels permanent"</em><sup>2</sup>. That hopelessness is the end product of many cycles of failed connections.</p>

                <p>Without intervention, it's not uncommon for disorganized attachers to become increasingly isolated over the years – perhaps having brief romances or friendships but nothing that lasts, as they repeatedly withdraw. This isolation then breeds things like <strong>hyper-independence</strong> (convincing themselves they don't need anyone) or, conversely, desperate plunges into new relationships that quickly flame out.</p>

                <p>Nade, I saw this damage accumulating in you. The GHB use became more extreme, especially during times of conflict or after you saw Ian. You'd become unreachable, sometimes for hours, falling around, hurting yourself, losing memories. You told me you used it "not to feel anything." That sounds like trying to cope with overwhelming internal pain. Each time you lied or betrayed the trust between us, the guilt must have piled up, making you feel worse about yourself, even if you blamed me outwardly. The finger-cutting incident after being late for Christo felt like an explosion of unresolved emotional pain. You seemed trapped, wanting connection but using substances and avoidance to numb the fear and shame, which only made you feel more broken and isolated over time.</p>

        <p>The <strong>relational damage</strong> is also significant. They may leave a trail of hurt ex-partners, confused friends, and family members who feel shut out. Over time, some may stop trying to get close to the person, having been burned too many times.</p>

                <p>Tragically, this can "prove" to the disorganized individual that people always abandon them – not seeing how their own behavior played a role in pushing people away. For example, an avoidant who ghosts friends repeatedly might find that eventually, the invitations stop coming; they then lament, <em>"See, no one actually cares to check on me,"</em> not fully acknowledging that friends <em>did</em> care but got tired of one-sided effort.</p>

                <p>Similarly, ex-partners might implement <em>no-contact</em> to heal themselves from the chaos, which the avoidant may interpret as <em>"they never loved me anyway to cut me off like this."</em> One avoidant man, after his girlfriend finally refused further contact, said <em>"I cannot fathom how she can just cut me out entirely… she’d become a real friend – I don't understand how to pretend like she's just dead and gone."</em><sup>1</sup> From her perspective, likely, she had to cut him off to protect herself (after enduring his on/off). But from his, it was a shock – he expected perhaps that he could keep her in his life somehow. When she didn’t, it was another data point reinforcing his sadness and confusion about how relationships end for him.</p>

                <p>The damage to our relationship was immense. I felt constantly confused, hurt, and anxious. I kept trying to understand why you pushed me away, sending long messages and videos, trying desperately to reconnect. But my efforts often seemed to make things worse, pushing you further away. When you left and then came back with Hubert, robbing me and leaving me homeless, that was the ultimate relational damage. You didn't just end the relationship; you destroyed the foundation of trust and safety we once had. Now, you won't talk to me, you block me, and you act like I'm the monster. This fits the pattern: you likely feel overwhelmed by guilt and shame, so you cut me off completely, perhaps telling yourself I deserved it or that I was the problem, instead of facing the damage caused by your actions and Hubert's manipulation.</p>

        <h3>Becoming More "Dismissive" Over Time</h3>

        <p>Without intervention, the cycle can lead some disorganized attachers to become increasingly <strong>dismissive</strong> over time as a defense. That is, whereas they started more fearful (anxious-avoidant), repeated pain might push them more into true avoidant territory as a coping style – essentially giving up on love and closeness to avoid the hurt.</p>

                <p>They might decide to have only casual relationships or avoid dating altogether ("I'm better off alone") which might seem stable but often leaves them unfulfilled, basically <em>imprisoned by their own walls</em>. On the other end, some lean into the anxious side too much – chasing relationship after relationship to "fix" the last one, without ever addressing why things keep breaking. Both routes tend to lead to more heartbreak.</p>

                <p>The <strong>culmination of damage</strong> can sometimes be severe mental health crises. It's not uncommon for those with disorganized attachment to hit a point, perhaps after a particularly painful breakup or life setback, where all the unresolved trauma comes crashing down. Emotional breakdowns can occur, as one commenter described <em>"ended with me having an emotional breakdown… but I absolutely will not give up on myself"</em><sup>1</sup>. If they reach out for help at this point, that crisis can become a turning point. If not, they might entrench further in their maladaptive beliefs, potentially developing mood disorders or personality disorder traits.</p>

                <p>Your behavior after the breakup, especially the cruelty and dismissiveness you showed (mocking me, saying hurtful things like "we were never a couple and what you said above. That was crue), seems like a hardening. It's as if the guilt and pain were too much, so you adopted a colder, more dismissive stance to protect yourself. Saying you "don't care" that Hubert lied is a prime example of this dismissiveness. It feels like you've shut down emotionally, perhaps convincing yourself you're better off alone or that relationships aren't worth the pain, which is a tragic outcome of this cycle. It might feel safer now, but it keeps you imprisoned and prevents real healing or connection.</p>

        <h3>Breaking the Cycle</h3>

        <p>On the flip side, if the cycle is recognized, it <strong>can</strong> be broken. But it usually requires a conscious effort to do the opposite of what the "avoidance habit" dictates. That can feel like swimming upstream in a flood of instinct.</p>

                <p>For instance, if normally when you feel smothered you ghost someone, breaking the cycle means <em>not ghosting</em>, instead maybe communicating "I need a little space but I care about you" – a hugely uncomfortable change for a fearful-avoidant, but crucial to get a different outcome (i.e., the friend gives space but doesn't feel abandoned, and the friendship survives, teaching the FA that they can set boundaries without losing people).</p>

                <p>Therapy often focuses on these small new behaviors that disconfirm the avoidant's fears, slowly building a new narrative. One reason therapy and time can help is that they allow the person to reflect on the pattern across relationships. It's hard to see the <em>cycle</em> when you're in it; each instance just feels like fresh chaos.</p>

                <p>But when patterns become clear – <em>"This is the fifth partner who said I shut them out… maybe it's not that I just pick wrong people or that love is impossible; maybe I'm doing something consistently to contribute"</em> – then change becomes possible. Some in recovery note that they had to accept that “the only common denominator in all my relationships was me,” not in a self-loathing way, but in an empowering way (because if it’s their patterns, they can work on them).</p>

                <p>Breaking this cycle for you, Nade, would mean acknowledging the pattern. It would mean recognizing that pushing me away when things got close, or lying about seeing Ian, wasn't just a one-off mistake but part of a larger pattern driven by fear. It means seeing that blaming my reactions was easier than facing your own guilt. The first step is realizing, "Maybe it wasn't just him; maybe my fear of vulnerability played a huge role." Acknowledging this pattern – the sabotage, the avoidance, the deflection – is the only way to start choosing differently next time, whether with me or someone else. It’s about realizing you *do* have a choice, even when your instincts scream to run.</p>

        <h3>The Path Forward</h3>

        <p>In summary, the disorganized avoidant often lives in a <strong>self-reinforcing loop</strong>: <em>Avoid intimacy → lose intimacy → feel unworthy and afraid → avoid intimacy even more</em>. Each loop strengthens their belief that intimacy = pain and that they are either doomed to be alone or only worthy of toxic love.</p>

        <p>Breaking this cycle is challenging but essential. The damage done by each iteration can be healed, but only if the cycle is interrupted – usually by the person developing insight into their patterns and learning new ways to respond to fear (or by hitting a rock bottom that forces change).</p>

        <p>The next section will discuss how a securely attached individual would handle similar situations differently – shedding light on what healthier patterns look like. Then we'll move into concrete pathways for those with disorganized attachment to break the cycle and start healing.</p>
