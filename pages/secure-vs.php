        <h2>How Secure Attachment Differs: Reactions in Similar Situations</h2>

        <p>It may be helpful to contrast the behaviors of a disorganized avoidant person with how a <strong>securely attached</strong> person would likely respond in the same scenarios. Securely attached individuals aren't devoid of fear or never upset – but they have a foundation of trust in themselves and others that profoundly shapes their reactions.</p>

        <p>By highlighting these differences, we can see more clearly what is <em>possible</em> in healthy relating, and also provide a model for the fearful-avoidant to work toward.</p>

                <p><strong>Fearful-Avoidant Response:</strong> Often withdraws or "deactivates" when a relationship deepens (for example, after exchanging vulnerable feelings or increasing commitment). Might ghost for a weekend or start a fight to create distance, leaving the partner in the dark.</p>

                <p><strong>Secure Response:</strong> <em>Embraces the deepening intimacy</em>. If they feel a bit nervous (which is normal when getting closer), they tend to <em>communicate</em> that openly or seek reassurance in a direct way, rather than pulling away. For instance, if a secure person feels scared about how much they love their partner, they might say, "I'm a little scared because this means a lot to me," and allow their partner to support them.</p>

                <p>A secure person trusts that <em>needing someone doesn't equal weakness</em>, whereas a disorganized avoidant often feels needing someone is dangerous. One woman who had dated avoidants exclaimed after finding a secure partner: <em>"None of this wishy-washy bullshit, no running away from big feelings… it feels deeply organic and genuine"</em>, whereas past partners got spooked as soon as emotions grew<sup>1</sup>. The secure partner’s attitude was “I’m super into this girl, let me show her and try to connect with her,” which is straightforward and consistent<sup>2</sup>.</p>

                <p>In our story, Nade (fearful-avoidant) consistently pulled away or sabotaged intimacy when the relationship with Charl deepened (e.g., after saying "more than friends," or after he expressed love). In contrast, Charl (leaning secure, despite trauma) consistently sought connection, tried to communicate his feelings (even if sometimes in messages or flawed ways), and desired to build stability, reflecting a secure inclination towards embracing intimacy rather than fleeing it.</p>

                <p><strong>Fearful-Avoidant Response:</strong> Might internalize resentment and then lash out with <em>blame</em> ("You never care about me!") or punish by withdrawing, rather than vulnerably stating their need. If their partner comes to them upset, they often hear criticism as "you're a failure" and either go on the defensive or shut down.</p>

                <p><strong>Secure Response:</strong> Will generally <em>address issues head-on but calmly</em>. If they feel hurt by something, they will tell their partner/friend in a non-accusatory way, and expect to talk it through. They also are willing to listen and apologize when they're at fault. They do <strong>not</strong> immediately assume the relationship is ending just because there's a disagreement.</p>

                <p>For example, if a secure person feels their needs weren't met one week, they might say, "Hey, I've been feeling a bit distant – can we spend some quality time together and talk about it?" Essentially, secure people have <em>stable self-esteem</em> that isn't shattered by conflict, allowing them to stay engaged and empathetic, whereas disorganized attachers have <em>fragile self-worth</em> that makes conflict feel like a survival threat. The difference might be night and day: a secure partner can have a tense discussion but still express love and reassurance throughout (“I’m upset right now, but I love you and we’ll work this out”), while a disorganized partner might either explode with no reassurance or disappear entirely, leaving the other feeling abandoned.</p>

                 <p>In our story, Nade often responded to conflict with withdrawal, blame ("now she's accusing me..."), or escalation (breaking things, provoking Charl). Charl, while reacting poorly under extreme stress (shouting, name-calling), consistently tried to *address* the issues, seeking explanations and resolution ("I just wanted the truth," attempting conversations, sending messages/videos). This reflects a secure tendency to engage with problems, contrasting with Nade's avoidant tendency to shut down or deflect.</p>

                <p><strong>Secure Response:</strong> If a breakup does occur, generally handles it with <em>communication, respect, and boundaries</em>. They will have a conversation, express feelings, and seek closure in a respectful way.

                <p>After a breakup, a secure ex will usually <em>respect no-contact or boundaries</em> and not send mixed signals.

If they have an issue or even if they were to break up, a secure person will usually articulate what's wrong rather than ghost or be cruel.

                <p><strong>Fearful-Avoidant Response:</strong> Often choose people who match their trauma (toxic, abandoning, etc.) and might stay even when mistreated because it feels "normal."

The key difference is a secure person generally doesn't <em>personalize</em> every relationship failure as proof they are unworthy – they have an underlying sense of worth that persists. They view breakups as sometimes just incompatibility, not a verdict on their self. The fearful-avoidant tends to internalize each loss as “something is wrong with me” or “yet another person hurt me,” reinforcing their negative worldview.</p>

                <p>Let's say both a secure person and a disorganized avoidant person start dating someone they really like, and after a couple of months, their new partner has to cancel a weekend together due to a work emergency.</p>

                <p><strong>The Secure Person</strong> might feel a twinge of disappointment, but their default assumption is "things happen, it's not a sign they don't care." They might say, "No worries, let's reschedule for next weekend. Good luck with work!" They might also use the free time to do something enjoyable on their own, feeling secure that the bond is intact.</p>

                <p>If they did feel worried, they would likely voice it calmly: "I understand you have to work; I was just really looking forward to seeing you. Can we plan something soon so I have something to look forward to? I just miss you." That kind of response invites reassurance and closeness.</p>

                <p><strong>The Fearful-Avoidant Person</strong> is likely to feel triggered: maybe their mind goes, "They don't want to see me. Are they losing interest? What if they're making excuses?" They might respond in a variety of insecure ways: perhaps with passive-aggressive comments (<em>"Fine, whatever, I figured you'd cancel"</em>), or by emotionally shutting down (<em>"ok. talk later."</em> and then being unavailable to the partner for a while out of hurt).</p>

                <p>Internally they might spiral into anxiety or bitterness.

The fearful-avoidant's response (snarky or cold or overly needy) might provoke an argument or confusion, creating drama where there didn't need to be any. This then <em>reinforces</em> their feeling that partners are unreliable or that they can't express needs (because in this case the partner might get upset at being treated with suspicion).</p>

        <h3>Consistent Love vs. Intermittent Reinforcement</h3>

        <p>As mentioned earlier, disorganized attachers often crave those highs and lows. A secure person finds joy in consistent love and might describe a happy relationship as "easy" or "peaceful" in many ways. A fearful-avoidant might actually equate "easy/peaceful" with "boring/lacking passion" because they're so used to adrenaline.</p>

        <p>The secure person doesn't require drama to feel love; a simple night in with trust and affection is satisfying. The fearful-avoidant often only "feels" love when there's some tension or uncertainty (because that churn of emotions is what they recognize as love). This is why someone who's secure might not understand why their partner (if disorganized) seems to provoke issues out of nowhere – the avoidant might subconsciously be creating <em>familiar chaos</em> because stable calm intimacy is uncomfortable. Secures generally don't do that; if things are good, they let them be good and enjoy it.</p>

        <h3>Summary: The Secure Foundation</h3>

        <p>In summary, securely attached individuals handle relational situations with a baseline of <em>trust, communication, and self-regulation</em>. They assume good faith from others unless proven otherwise, they express needs and grievances without excessive fear of abandonment or engulfment, and they can tolerate intimacy and time alone in balanced measure.</p>

        <p>Their actions tend to be <em>direct and congruent</em> with their feelings – no heavy mask of sarcasm when hurt, no silent treatment out of the blue, no flirty revenge if feeling insecure. In contrast, disorganized attachers' actions are often <em>misaligned</em> with their true feelings (they act angry when they're really scared, or act indifferent when they're actually hurting, etc.) because of those defense mechanisms.</p>

        <p>For a fearful-avoidant who has perhaps never seen what secure behavior looks like, learning these differences can be eye-opening. It provides a sort of roadmap for what healthier responses entail. The good news is that these are <strong>learnable skills</strong>. People do move from insecure to secure (known as "earned secure" attachment) by understanding and practicing these kinds of behaviors and, importantly, healing the underlying wounds that make the insecure responses so strong.</p>

        <p>With this comparison in mind, we now turn to the hopeful part of this guide: <em>pathways to awareness and recovery</em>. Knowing the problem is only half the battle; the real goal is to help disorganized avoidant individuals recognize themselves in these patterns and take steps to break free, moving toward more secure and fulfilling relationships.</p>
