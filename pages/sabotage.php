    <h2>Sabotage Through Cheating and Quick Rebounds</h2>

    <p>Many disorganized avoidants engage in <strong>self-sabotage</strong> of their relationships, and one destructive form this can take is <strong>infidelity</strong>. It may seem counterintuitive – why would someone who is afraid of abandonment risk destroying their relationship by cheating? The key is to understand that, for these individuals, <em>intimacy itself feels dangerous</em>.</p>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research" style="display: block;">
            <p>Engaging with a third party (emotionally or physically) can be a subconscious way to <em>create emotional distance</em> or an "escape hatch" in their primary relationship. It's a way to <em>feel connection without the vulnerability</em> that true one-on-one intimacy with their partner demands.</p>

            <p>As one attachment expert explains, <em>"Another withdrawal behavior that a disorganized attacher may engage in when attempting to distance themselves from intimacy is infidelity."</em> According to research, someone with this attachment style is indeed <em>more likely to "act out" sexually as an attempt to connect <strong>without</strong> intimacy</em> (<a href="https://www.attachmentproject.com/disorganized-attachment-relationships/#:~:text=Another%20withdrawal%20behavior%20that%20a,attempt%20to%20connect%20without%20intimacy" target="_blank">Disorganized Attachment Style in Relationships | AP</a>). In other words, a fling or an affair provides a hit of attention or validation **minus** the obligations and deep emotional investment of their committed relationship. It’s intimacy-lite – enough to soothe loneliness, not enough to threaten their protective walls.</p>

            <p>In one real-life example, a woman maintained an <strong>emotional affair</strong> with her ex while in a new relationship, effectively keeping a safety net. When her boyfriend eventually discovered this, she broke up with him via text, claiming she needed to "sort out her emotions" about the ex (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Her%20text%20said%20that%20she%E2%80%99d,claimed%20she%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20pursing%20him" target="_blank">For those who’ve been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps</a>).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal" style="display: none;">
            <p>In our story, Nade maintained contact with and eventually slept with a client (Ian) she had a history with, even after promising Charl she wouldn't. Charl reflects, "she's been sleeping with two of her clients all the time... And it was the same... guy she slept with when we stayed in Silverton." This wasn't just about money; it created emotional distance and conflict, acting as an escape valve whenever intimacy with Charl intensified.</p>

    <h3>The Fear Behind the Betrayal</h3>

    <p>Often these infidelities are not driven by lust or a lack of love for the partner, but by <em>fear and self-sabotage</em>. The person might feel the relationship is getting "too serious" or that they are "losing themselves," and instead of communicating this fear, they impulsively seek solace in someone else's arms or an online flirtation.</p>

            <button class="tab-btn" data-tab="personal">Personal Example</button>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research" style="display: block;">
            <p>It's almost a twisted form of <strong>control</strong> – <em>if I already ruined it by cheating, I don't have to face the terror of a genuinely close relationship or the possibility of you leaving me first</em>. Sadly, this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: the betrayal often <em>does</em> lead to the loss of the relationship, thus confirming the avoidant's belief that they are unlovable or that people inevitably leave. Insecure attachment – especially with high avoidance or anxiety – correlates with higher likelihood of infidelity (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10754894/#:~:text=,to%20engage%20in%20marital%20infidelity" target="_blank">The interplay of attachment styles and marital infidelity: A systematic ...</a>). The fearful-avoidant happens to have *both* high anxiety and avoidance, making them particularly vulnerable to this trap.</p>

            <p>In another account, a man discovered his fearful-avoidant partner had been <em>emotionally cheating with a couple of guys</em> throughout their year-long situationship (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1evcmvh/has_anyone_had_a_fearful_avoidant_partner/#:~:text=over%20a%20year%2C%20two%20months,ways%20in%20a%20healthy%20manner" target="_blank">Has anyone had a Fearful Avoidant partner? : r/cheating_stories</a>). She hadn't physically left him (until he finally ended it), but she never fully committed to him either. She kept him as a placeholder while obsessing over an ex friends-with-benefits who treated her poorly – <em>"she still wasn't over her ex FWB who never had feelings for her, and kept taking his breadcrumbs"</em> (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1evcmvh/has_anyone_had_a_fearful_avoidant_partner/#:~:text=over%20a%20year%2C%20two%20months,ways%20in%20a%20healthy%20manner" target="_blank">Has anyone had a Fearful Avoidant partner? : r/cheating_stories</a>). This indicates how a disorganized person might be **mentally one foot out the door**, sabotaging the stable relationship in favor of the abandoning ex. The new partner felt *used to fill a void* while she chased the unavailable person (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1evcmvh/has_anyone_had_a_fearful_avoidant_partner/#:~:text=emotionally%20draining%20for%20me%2C%20she,ways%20in%20a%20healthy%20manner" target="_blank">Has anyone had a Fearful Avoidant partner? : r/cheating_stories</a>).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal" style="display: none;">
            <p>In our story, Nade repeatedly sabotaged moments of stability or forward movement by bringing up her job or reconnecting with clients, especially Ian. Charl notes, "It's like every single time she does anything that moves her forward... she has to sabotage it." Her decision to see Ian again that final weekend, despite promising to stop and knowing it would hurt Charl, served as a mechanism to create distance and potentially justify leaving, fulfilling her fear that the relationship couldn't handle the pressure (pressure she created).</p>

    <h3>The Rebound Cycle</h3>

    <p>When these relationships inevitably collapse, disorganized attachers often cope through <strong>rapid rebound relationships or flings</strong>. Rather than processing the heartbreak or examining their role in it, they tend to <em>numb the pain through distraction</em>.</p>

            <button class="tab-btn" data-tab="personal">Personal Example</button>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research" style="display: block;">
            <p>Research has noted that the fearful-avoidant style is <em>associated with rushing into rebound relationships</em> as a way to escape the negative emotions after a breakup (<a href="https://www.attachmentproject.com/disorganized-attachment-relationships/#:~:text=Disorganized%20attachment%20breakups%20tend%20to,such%20as%20by%20abusing%20substances" target="_blank">Disorganized Attachment Style in Relationships | AP</a>). One guide on attachment styles describes disorganized attachment breakups as a <em>"rollercoaster"</em> – initially the person will do anything to avoid the pain, often through unhealthy behaviors like substance use or jumping immediately into a new romance (<a href="https://www.attachmentproject.com/disorganized-attachment-relationships/#:~:text=Disorganized%20attachment%20breakups%20tend%20to,such%20as%20by%20abusing%20substances" target="_blank">Disorganized Attachment Style in Relationships | AP</a>).</p>

            <p>We can see this in anecdotal accounts: the boyfriend who was dumped via text discovered just two weeks later that his ex had <strong>reactivated her dating app profile</strong> (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=I%20threw%20everything%20I%20had,activated%20Tinder%20profile" target="_blank">For those who’ve been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps</a>). It was as if she couldn't tolerate being alone with her feelings for even a moment – she needed a new source of attention right away, whether to validate herself or simply distract from guilt and loss.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal" style="display: none;">
            <p>In our story, after the final breakup where Charl hit Nade, she immediately went to stay with Hubert, the man who had been subtly undermining the relationship. Charl notes, "she was at Hubert's place... And then he told me that... he got a lawyer... [and] probably told her not to speak to me." Within weeks, she started "sleeping together" with Hubert. This rapid move into a new situation with someone involved in the previous relationship's breakdown suggests a rebound pattern aimed at avoiding the pain and complexity of the breakup with Charl.</p>

    <h3>The Circle Back Pattern</h3>

    <p>Despite the apparent rush to move on, many fearful-avoidants will later try to reconnect with their exes, creating a pattern of leaving and returning.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research" style="display: block;">
            <p>In one story, a fearful-avoidant man who ghosted a relationship came back a month later to test the waters, and when rejected, was <em>"back"</em> again a few months after <em>that</em>, only to find his ex had moved on (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Oh%2C%20funny%20to%20find%20this,breaking%20up%20before%20defining%20things" target="_blank">For those who’ve been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps</a>) (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=He%20tried%20to%20reapproach%20me,feels%20deeply%20organic%20and%20genuine" target="_blank">For those who’ve been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps</a>). By the time he returned, she had found a healthy love, and she noted the stark contrast between <em>his</em> on-and-off approach and her new partner's steady, genuine love (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=back,feels%20deeply%20organic%20and%20genuine" target="_blank">For those who’ve been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps</a>).</p>

            <p>This highlights that disorganized individuals may even <em>overlap</em> relationships – reaching out to an ex while starting with someone new, or vice versa – constantly seeking that attachment but in a fragmented way. A discussion among betrayed partners on Reddit revealed that many who were dumped by disorganized-attached exes did hear from them again months later, often with the ex expressing confusion or regret (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Two%20weeks%20later%20I%20came,activated%20Tinder%20profile" target="_blank">For those who’ve been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps</a>) (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Oh%2C%20funny%20to%20find%20this,breaking%20up%20before%20defining%20things" target="_blank">For those who’ve been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps</a>).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal" style="display: none;">
            <p>In our story, Nade left Charl in May 2023 and had limited contact for six months. She then re-initiated contact, apologized, and returned. This pattern of leaving abruptly and later attempting reconciliation aligns with the disorganized tendency to circle back after the initial fear subsides and feelings of loss or regret emerge.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>The Pain Behind the Pattern</h3>

    <p>It's important to stress that these rebounds and affairs are <em>not about malice or a cavalier attitude toward others' feelings</em>. They are usually desperate (if misguided) attempts to <em>regulate emotions</em>.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research" style="display: block;">
            <p>A fearful-avoidant who feels abandoned or who has sabotaged a relationship often has intense feelings of <strong>shame, self-loathing, and panic</strong> afterwards. Instead of constructively dealing with those feelings, they might try to <em>erase them by moving on quickly</em>.</p>

            <p>One attachment coach explained that avoidant types may "monkey-branch" (swing to a new partner) because <em>being alone with their emotions is intolerable</em>, yet being truly intimate is also scary – so they seek a new infatuation high to distract them (<a href="https://www.attachmentproject.com/disorganized-attachment-relationships/#:~:text=However%2C%20inevitably%2C%20the%20negative%20feelings,the%20end%20of%20a%20relationship" target="_blank">Disorganized Attachment Style in Relationships | AP</a>). Unfortunately, this prevents genuine healing and usually spreads the pain around to new people.</p>
            <p>Moreover, some disorganized avoidants are **sexually impulsive** as part of their attachment issues. They might engage in casual sex or serial dating as a way to get physical closeness without emotional strings. The Attachment Project notes that these individuals sometimes use sex as a tool to avoid conflict or deeper intimacy – the physical act gives a momentary feeling of connection but “they don’t have to address the underlying problems in the relationship” (<a href="https://www.attachmentproject.com/disorganized-attachment-relationships/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20someone%20with%20a%20disorganized,conflict%20in%20the%20first%20place" target="_blank">Disorganized Attachment Style in Relationships | AP</a>). The same source then explains infidelity as a further step: connecting elsewhere to avoid true intimacy (<a href="https://www.attachmentproject.com/disorganized-attachment-relationships/#:~:text=Another%20withdrawal%20behavior%20that%20a,attempt%20to%20connect%20without%20intimacy" target="_blank">Disorganized Attachment Style in Relationships | AP</a>).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal" style="display: none;">
             <p>In our story, Nade's repeated infidelity, particularly with Ian, despite knowing it hurt Charl and violated their agreements, can be seen as a maladaptive coping mechanism. Charl theorizes, "It is like every single time she does anything that moves her forward... she simply has to sabotage it." Her actions, driven perhaps by fear of intimacy or guilt, served to create distance and regulate her overwhelming emotions, albeit destructively. Her immediate move to Hubert post-breakup also fits the pattern of avoiding the pain of loss through a quick new connection.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Understanding the Damage</h3>

    <p><strong>The damage caused by these behaviors is significant.</strong> To the partners and friends, the cheating or serial rebounds feel profoundly <em>betraying and destabilizing</em>. For the disorganized person, each instance of sabotage and its fallout often <em>reinforces their internalized shame</em>. They often end up despising themselves for hurting others, which only fuels their sense of unworthiness and can further entrench the avoidant behavior (a vicious cycle).</p>

    <p>In sum, <strong>lying and cheating</strong> for a disorganized avoidant aren't thrill-seeking behaviors; they are <em>maladaptive coping mechanisms</em>. The fearful-avoidant wants love but on terms they can control. Having side interactions or an easy rebound gives them an "out" from the terrifying intimacy of a real relationship. It’s a way to self-soothe their fear of dependence: if one connection becomes too much, they have another to lean on or escape to.</p>

    <p>Understanding this can help both the individuals and those they hurt begin to make sense of seemingly senseless betrayals. The key insight is that these behaviors stem from attachment trauma, not from a desire to harm. This doesn't excuse the pain they cause, but it does provide a framework for healing and potentially changing these destructive patterns.</p>

    <h3>Breaking the Cycle</h3>

    <p>For those with this attachment style, recognizing these self-sabotaging patterns is the first step toward change. For partners, understanding that these behaviors are often fear-based rather than malicious can help make sense of painful experiences, even if it doesn't erase the hurt.</p>

    <p>Recovery typically involves therapy focused on attachment issues, developing emotional regulation skills, and gradually building tolerance for intimacy without the need for escape hatches or self-sabotage.</p>
