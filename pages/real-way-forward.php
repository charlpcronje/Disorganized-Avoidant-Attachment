        This isn’t about reopening wounds. It’s about finally understanding what happened between us—not just the events, but the *patterns* underneath. I blamed you. Then I blamed myself. Then I discovered something that made everything click: disorganized attachment.

        I know you were diagnosed with BPD when you were younger. But maybe... that wasn’t the whole story. Maybe you were just surviving in the only way you knew how, because love and fear got wired together early in life. When things got close, it triggered danger—even if part of you wanted that closeness deeply. That push-pull… I get it now.

        I want you to read the two sections below if and when you’re ready. I gave all our messages to Gemini AI, and the insights it gave me changed how I see everything that happened between us. I see your fear now. I see your heart beneath it. I see *you*.

Charl's reactions, as you've described them throughout the story (including the shouting, name-calling, persistence, emotional distress, and even the final physical incident), make a lot of sense when viewed as the responses of someone experiencing Nade's disorganized avoidant behaviors **without** having the framework of attachment theory to understand them...

Yes, it's absolutely possible that a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) could have been a misdiagnosis, or perhaps an incomplete picture, with the core issue being Disorganized (Fearful-Avoidant) attachment...

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>
        I’m not asking for anything. You don’t owe me a reply. I just wanted to share this—because it helped me find peace, and maybe one day, it can help you too.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you ever want to talk, I’m here. If not, that’s okay too. This is for your healing, your clarity, your peace.
    </p>

    <p>With love,<br/>Charl</p>
