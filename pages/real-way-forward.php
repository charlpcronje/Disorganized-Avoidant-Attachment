        <h2>Dear Nade</h2>
        <p>
        If you got to the end and you didn't listen to everything for whatever reason, and you feel like you didn't get anything from this, then it's because you didn't listen to everything. Nothing will change if you don't engage with anything that can bring change. This can bring change. And I think if you are now listening to this and you did go through everything, I think you will agree that this can bring change. 
        </br></br>
        Below is a private message to you. And then I'll leave you with some ideas of what you can do next to keep on healing and to really move forward. To not hide or run, but to actually move forward.
        </br></br>
        Remember, not everything you do have to be so final, that is black and white thinking and that is not helpful. You can talk to me like we use to, you can tell me how you feel and how you are really doing, I would love to know. You can be honest... I know that must sometimes feel impossible to do, but you can do it, and I will listen.

    <h2>The real way forward</h2>
    <div>

        <p>When I first saw this website take shape—when I started putting it all together—I already knew what the last part needed to be. I knew that the end of this site had to be <em>the way forward</em>. That was always clear to me.<br/>
        I didn't know what the rest would look like.<br/>
        I didn't know how we'd get here.<br/>
        But I knew that when it came to the end, it had to lead somewhere—not just stop.</p>

        <p>I was so sure I would know what to tell you when I got here.<br/>
        What I know—you now know too.<br/>
        And guess what? I have no idea what to do now.<br/>
        Not for you, and not for me.<br/>
        I wish someone would tell me what the way forward is.<br/>
        Up until now, I knew I had to tell you the things that I did, because I truly believed that if we understood these things, we could still be in October—when we were so happy.</p>

        <p>I'm not going to pretend I know what you should do.<br/>
        But what I do know is that you have a choice to make.<br/>
        You can choose to keep on avoiding. You can keep running.<br/>
        And both of us know that you will only end up hurting yourself and others.<br/>
        Avoidance always leads to more avoidance. There's no way around that.</p>

        <p>So maybe it's okay if I tell you that I also want things.<br/>
        I don't like always having to be the voice of reason and hope.<br/>
        I don't like always being the one who has to tell people the truth and what they need to hear.<br/>
        Why must I always give up everything, and feel so bad for also wanting to be loved, and needed, and appreciated?</p>

        <p>I don't have any plans forward. I guess I thought I would know when I got here.<br/>
        But I don't. I have nothing else to tell you.<br/>
        I have to make peace with the fact that you may never read anything that's on this website.<br/>
        Or that you do, but still choose to keep on running and avoiding.</p>

        <p>If that happens, and you keep pushing me away, then I'll have no more reason to contact you.<br/>
        Except to torture myself.<br/>
        To remind myself of what I once had, but what was stolen from me—by avoidance, and a lying, manipulative cunt.</p>

        <p>You were my way forward.<br/>
        And I loved every moment of that idea—of what I knew we could become.<br/>
        So I'm sorry I don't have some profound revelation for you about what to do next.<br/>
        So I'll do what I always do: I'll be honest.</p>

        <p>Together, we have a real way forward.<br/>
        I still love you.<br/>
        And if you didn't still feel something for me too,<br/>
        then it wouldn't have been so hard for you to talk to me.</p>

        <p>I want to be your real way forward.</p>

        <p>We were happy together. <em>Really</em> happy.<br/>
        And now that we understand, we can keep on being happy.<br/>
        We loved each other.<br/>
        We didn't want to lose each other.</p>

        <p>So why shouldn't we have what we both wanted so badly?</p>

        <p>Please don't let avoidance make this choice for you.<br/>
        Don't let us pay for the mistakes we made—for the rest of our lives.<br/>
        The real way forward is not apart.<br/>
        It's together.</p>

        <p><strong>With love and hope,</strong><br/>
        <strong>Charl</strong></p>

        <p><strong>P.S.</strong><br/>
        Take your time. Let everything you've read sink in.</p>

        <p>Finally—and I say this because I know you—<br/>
        If you just skimmed through these pages,<br/>
        if you didn't read everything,<br/>
        and you're about to avoid the rest and act like this doesn't matter,</p>

        <p>Then know this:</p>

        <p>You don't get to tell yourself that you did everything.<br/>
        And the next time you push someone away,<br/>
        or when you sabotage what could've been something good,</p>

        <p><strong>Remember this.</strong></p>

        <p>Remember that you had the chance <em>now</em>—<br/>
        to engage,<br/>
        to be free,<br/>
        to be happy.</p>

        <p>You don't get to lie to yourself about this anymore.</p>

        <p>This is real.<br/>
        And this is not just “who you are.”</p>

        <p><strong>You are the best.<br/>
        And I love you.</strong></p>
