<h3>Charl and Nade</h3>
When we met, I was really a broken person. I went through so much. I didn't look after myself anymore. I was like nothing compared to the man I used to be. But Nate listened to me. She helped me and we got all my clothes washed, the little bit I had left. And we sat and spoke for about three months. We just spoke. She also went through a bad breakup because she used to be a sensual masseuse. And even though I never wanted to meet anybody that was part of that industry, I didn't think anything of it back then because we were only talking. And she landed up in that guesthouse because she broke up with a guy who she used to work for that was the owner of a brothel. And she used to do sensual massages for him, for his company. And then later on, she stopped working. But the guy was very manipulative and like a narcissist. But she doesn't seem to notice that he abused her emotionally and psychologically. He basically forced her to dress the way he wanted her. And she had to act the way he wanted her to act. And he isolated her on a farm. And she completely stopped doing the normal stuff she liked doing, like having to get her hair done or nails done and all the normal stuff. He just said people with makeup on is fake, making her feel that she's being fake if she does it. And after about a year that they were together, she started using drugs because it's probably because she was suppressing herself so much, self-medicating or something. And then that got worse over time. And then instead of him standing by her and helping her through that time, he sent her away to Cape Town to one of her friends, but without money and without support. And there she had to clean houses for about six weeks, to get clean and to stop using drugs. And then finally, she went back to him. But then when he went back, he didn't really seem interested. And he just slept with her and then told her to leave. And then that's where she ended up at the guest house where I met.<br/>So, both of us went through quite a bad time, and before I met her at the guesthouse, she first started speaking to another guy that was also living at the guesthouse. His name was Hubert. And they became friends for about 2-3 weeks, and they were planning to then get a place to move out together because the guesthouse was expensive. And she also asked me if I didn't want to move in with the two of them, because all three of us went through breakups, and all of us needed a cheaper place to stay, so we thought it would be cool to just all three move in together. But then, one weekend, Hubert went to go see his kids, and then he didn't return for weeks, and maybe more than a month or two. And then I got a call from him the one weekend saying that he is being held for psychological evaluation or something like that somewhere, and that there was trouble with him and his family, and something happened. I don't know exactly what. Anyway, so me and Nade became closer and closer, and eventually we kept staying at the guesthouse, even though it was expensive. I still had some money saved that I was paying for both of us, and I didn't like her doing the job she did, the essential masseuse job. So most of the time she didn't work. She only went to work twice for six months that we stayed in that guesthouse. The first time it was in February, and we met in January, and she went to see her first client since I got to know her in February. But then when she came back, I could see in her eyes something was wrong. Something didn't look right. But when I asked her that, she didn't want to tell me.<br/>Because she didn't want to talk about it, I thought maybe if I write her a message, and I sort of explain to her what I think happened, and maybe she would be willing to talk to me about it, because I didn't want to put too much strain on her, because I didn't know her that well yet, but I did see that something was wrong, and because of my history and what I went through, I thought that maybe something happened and she may have slept with the client, and that is what was bothering her. And she also told me the next day when we walked to the shops that she uses GHB just to not feel anything, just so that she doesn't have to think about anything that's happening. We kept on talking and talking every day, and over time I started healing again, and I started getting up in the mornings and feeling happy that I'm alive again, and life started looking positive again. I really started liking her, and she also liked me, I could see that. And she even invited me to, in the evenings when we were just talking, because she had her own room in the guest house and me as well, but she invited me to just shower in her room, and we were sleeping most of the time in her room as well. So things were progressing in a direction, and we weren't, we were friends first. We weren't, not one of us really wanted a relationship then, but I was also not going to not feel what I was feeling now, because I'm not shy to admit to myself when I feel something, and even though it was only 3 or 4 months after I went though all of what I did, I could really feel that I started liking her a lot.So, one day, I told her that I like her, and that I feel that we are more than just friends. But then, she pulled away. She didn't want to admit it, or she didn't like the idea. That's what I thought. In my opinion, I could see that she did like me. But, her ex and what she went through kept on bothering her, and for some reason, she didn't want to admit anything. So, I dropped the subject, and the next day, she started thinking that I should move the stuff I took up to her room back down to my room, because she didn't want to make me think that there's more than just friendship.So, one day, I told her that I like her, and that I feel that we are more than just friends. But then, she pulled away. She didn't want to admit it, or she didn't like the idea. That's what I thought. In my opinion, I could see that she didn't like me. But, her ex and what she went through kept on bothering her, and for some reason, she didn't want to admit anything. So, I dropped the subject, and the next day, she started thinking that I should move the stuff I took up to her room back down to my room, because she didn't want to make me think that there's more than just friendship.Throughout this whole time, she was still using GHB, even though she wasn't working. And it was costing a lot of money, and I couldn't really tell her to stop, because we were not that close in the beginning, and by this time, if she didn't have anything for a day or so, she would really struggle. She would really get extreme adverse reactions, and she didn't feel well, and she could not even talk, and she was getting paranoia, and it was really bad when she didn't have anything. So, I started buying fur, but a lot less, so that she could stop getting off the stuff eventually. And she also didn't work, and I preferred it that she didn't go see the clients, because I didn't, because of my history, and sensual masseuse is, in a way, just prostitution, and I know that it does damage women in a way, and it's not good for any woman to be treated that way, and used in that way. But in April, she did go and see another client, and she came back at 3 o'clock in the morning, and the next day, she came and sat next to me on the bed, and she told me that more happened at the booking than she wanted to, and there was more than one client, and there was some other girls as well, and they pressured her into having sex with the one client, and she cried, and I held her, and we cried together. And by that stage, we were sharing a room in the guest house again, and because money was tight, we couldn't afford two rooms anymore, so we were sharing one room, and it also got us a bit closer, but because we were spending maybe so much time together, and because of stuff that happened with her job, and she was keeping me out of, she was keeping me from doing my job, because she was very, she got very reliant on me, for living expenses, and for just basic needs, because she was trying to leave GHB, and that made her so, that she really couldn't even speak, she couldn't speak to the landlords, she couldn't speak to other people, she was hiding away basically in the room, she was just moving between the room and the kitchen, and so on. I felt so sorry for her.Eventually, she broke a tooth and she needed to go to the dentist. By that stage the money was really low. So she asked a friend of hers if he would borrow her money, but then he would need it back within three days. So she decided that she's going to go back to that job, to go see clients on a regular basis. Which I didn't like, because I knew that we would be fine. I was starting to do work with some clients again, and even though things were tough, I didn't think that it's necessary to go that far. But two days later she went to the dentist, and then she came back, and the next day she had a booking the next morning. And that morning she sat with me, and she kept on getting calls from clients that were now going to book with her for an hour or two during the day. It really upset me, hearing her talking to these people. And I told her to at least just take the calls outside, not where I can hear it. Because by that stage, I've told her since that, well, the day she told me that things went too far with those clients, she also told me that she likes me more than a friend. So finally she admitted that to me too. So we were basically then starting a relationship. She didn't classify it as a relationship, but we were in a relationship. So I didn't like talking to those clients. So we had a fight, and she started insulting me, and I started shouting at her. And I called her names, and she left. And then the next night she came back, and she only came to get some stuff, and she moved out. And I was mortified. I didn't know what to do. Again, I am losing someone to that industry, and I told her two days before she left that I loved her. And I was crushed completely.
So, she told me that she left because of the stuff I said. I called her a whore that morning, I know it was shitty of me and that I should not have said it, but, you know, it was something I said not because I planned it, I planned to say it, but out of reaction and to what she's going to do for a job, and also, she's only gone to two bookings that all year so far, and she also admitted that on the first booking that I was worried about so much. She also told me that she also slept with the client back then. So, she only went to two bookings so far that year, and both times she slept with the client. So, she was not doing the job as a masseuse. She was sleeping with the client, and that made her what I told her she is, even though it's not a nice way of saying it. I was very angry and very upset and very heartbroken, and she wanted to go see clients again, and I just wanted her to realize what she's doing, and that it will be the end of us, and the new relationship we've started building, because no relationship can survive something like that.So for the next few months, I sent her a message every now and then, every day or two. And she also told me that she would start paying me back, because by that stage she owed me more than 20,000 Rand. And because I was so crushed and emotionally hurt, I struggled to keep on working. So she told me that she would start paying me back, because she was making money again. But I didn't really want any of the money she made that way. So I kept on struggling, and it took me about three months to get back on my feet. And then things were going well again. I was working for a company remotely, the company was in the UK. And I was making almost 100,000 Rand a month. And things were going well for me, work-wise. But emotionally, I was still missing her a lot. And I was still trying to make sense of everything. Because she didn't want to listen to any of my messages, or read any of my messages, or any of the videos I made. I created a nice video for her where I said sorry for the things I said. And it took me like two weeks to make the thing. Not like all day, every day, but it took me a while to make in my spare time. And she didn't want to look at it. And eventually she went to Cape Town. And she moved in with a guy there for about six weeks. His name is Eugene. And after six weeks, she also again told him that she's going to start doing that job. And he also didn't like it. So she also had a fight, and she also moved to her brother that also lives close to Cape Town. But then she was there for about a week. And by that time, me and her started speaking again. And she finally watched the videos I sent her. And she said sorry for everything. And she realized that I didn't mean anything bad when we had a fight. And she said sorry for the way she left, and for everything she said, and so on. And we sort of made up. And I bought her a ticket from Cape Town to come back to Victoria.But before she came to Pretoria, I told her that I don't like her doing that job, and I made enough money that she didn't have to work. But she told me that she does want to make her own money, and she's not going to not work. So I told her, well, if that's the case, then she must start looking for alternative ways of income. And she also cried over the phone, and she told me that she doesn't want to do that job anymore, but that's something she's been doing for a long time. So I told her that when she comes to Pretoria, I'll pay for our basic expenses, but then she must start looking for an alternate way of income. And we had some ideas that we were talking about. But the deal was that she would not go to client houses, that she would not sleep with any clients, that she would work in a place that's secure, where there's massage beds, and where she's got backup if something would go wrong, and if a client would try something, that she would be safe. And that was the deal, and she agreed to it. So I bought her the plane ticket to come back to Pretoria.It was quite funny, the day she was supposed to fly to Pretoria, she missed her first flight, and then she went to the bank while she was waiting for the second flight, she missed the second one as well, and then finally she got onto the third flight, but then when she got to Joburg International, she dropped her phone, and she couldn't get an Uber from the airport to where I was staying, still in Silverton, and she was late, and then I started worrying because she didn't arrive when she was supposed to, but I trusted her that she would come, and eventually, late at night, she got there, and she made some transport arrangements with a taxi cab, but she couldn't pay him, so she left some of her luggage with him, so that when he said he could keep that until we could pay the bill, so a few days later, I paid the taxi ride, and I had to pay 2000 Rand extra to get her luggage back, which was ridiculous, but it's the only thing we could do.<br/>So then finally I moved out of that guesthouse in Silverton. And because we didn't have our own place yet, we stayed in an Airbnb for the first night, because we didn't have a chance to look for something together yet. So we stayed there for the first night, and we really enjoyed our first night together. We spent all night talking, we went to bath together, and it was a really nice night. And I couldn't believe how... how it just felt like she's never been gone. And how it just felt right for me. And we were getting along so well for the next two months. Everything was perfect. At first we stayed in a hotel, and then finally we got a nice place It was like a... It was a little thatched roof cottage. It was really like a fairy tale. It was so nice. And it was spacious. It was... Well, it didn't have many rooms. It was one bedroom and a kitchen and a bathroom. And a sitting room and a bedroom was sort of one. But it was perfect for us. It was really cozy. And we enjoyed spending time together. So it was really nice for the beginning.
The deal was that I wouldn't say anything about her job. I would just support her and that she would start doing some other things for income. And so she decided that she's going to start a... Well, she had two different plans for what to do. Firstly, she wanted to start a website where she can have content loaded. It would be photos of herself in lingerie and things like that. And she would sell some content, almost like an OnlyFans account, but just her own website. And she would also sell products on there. Things that she thought her clients would like to buy. Because she's been doing that job for so long, she would have a lot of people that would want to buy content because they always ask her for stuff. And I thought that's better because at least then she won't be seeing the clients anymore. And because she was comfortable with being nude in front of people, she didn't mind taking photos and things. And she also wanted to start an e-commerce shop, like just selling normal products, because one of her friends was importing things from another country that's not available here yet, which was quite expensive stuff. But she also thought that she could then sell online to local clients. And that was her two plans. But she never really put much effort into it. She kept on seeing clients, maybe two or three clients a week. So it wasn't much money that she made. Maybe she would ask 1,500 Rand an hour. But compared to what I was earning, it was really not much. So it hurt me all the time when she was going to see clients. And every now and then she started going to clients' houses as well, which I didn't like at all because that's what happened the year before. I mean, it happened that she slept with two clients. And we had a fight about it. And the fights became more and more. And she started using more GHB. And eventually we started fighting like every second day. It was just because I felt that I was doing my part of the deal. I was looking after her. I was not complaining about her job. Not until then. But she was not paying any attention to any other forms of income. It was three months and she still just started with the logo. She kept on doing the logo over and over because of GHB. She kept on forgetting things. And she couldn't focus on anything. So she kept on restarting the project. And we decided on using Shopify, which is an easy thing to do. And at that stage, she's already been working on Shopify to set up the one shop for two months, which is not supposed to take that long. Not for just a few products.Then one day we just sat and we spoke and we decided okay now we can't go on like this we can't keep on fighting like this it's ridiculous, so we decided to we um we spoke about our deal again and we said okay let's stick to the deal let's reaffirm the deal and stop fighting and let's try to get along because we did like each other a lot and by that stage I've loved her since Silverton and I've also told her a few times since then and I love her but she's never responded in kind but I could see she does. Again things were fine and for about two months we never had a fight and then on Christmas Eve. I don't know what happened on Christmas Eve but, she used too much GHB that night and I know when she's used too much because she starts falling around and she can't walk up straight and she starts just saying random words and she would hit herself and, then she would start insulting me and she would start pushing me away and throwing with stuff and become violent and it's really terrible and she started screaming and screaming and it just went on for hours about five six hours she just kept on going crazy and she would swear and it was really not good and eventually the owner that lives next door came to us and he said she must leave. So that night she went to a guest house that is not too far away.
⁉️So she was gone for about 10 days. Then she came back in January and things were a bit strange. I could sense something was off, but she came back and I was happy and the owner accepted that she was back. But then she told me that she wanted to start living in the guest house during the week and then she would come home on weekends. I didn't like that because I found out that the guest house was a brothel and not a guest house. And we had a fight again. That's the first time we really had a fight about that job again. And it was a bad fight and she left again that day. She was only back for two days and then she left again. But I paid for her for a proper guest house. I asked her not to go back to where she was, saying I would pay for a proper guest house. I paid for her and she told me that she was going to stay with another woman there to save money. And I gave her enough money so that she didn't have to see clients. But I knew she would, but she wouldn't do anything that she wouldn't normally do, like sleep with clients or do anything like that. Two weeks later she came back for the weekend and we spent the weekend together and it was really nice. We both cried when she went back to that guest house where she was staying. And then about a week later she told me that she had met someone and I was heartbroken and I told her to come to my place and let's talk about this, what's going on. Because I was still paying for a guest house and she'd never said anything before that. And then she said that she was in fact actually staying with another guy from day one in the room and I was paying for both of them and they were sleeping together. But this guy had become violent and she wanted to get away from him and asked if I would ever help her and that she was going to go back to the guest house, just to pack her stuff and then find a way to sneak away. And then two days later she would meet me somewhere and then I would also need to move because this guy was really violent and he would come looking. But then two days later she called me and then he got arrested, that guy got arrested. So then she came back and I was really sad because she basically took advantage of me for that month and she was sleeping with another guy and I was paying for both of them and I was so heartbroken. But we made up and we did have a lot of fights about that as time went forward. But eventually, I just forgave her. When she came back from the guesthouse, she was really not doing well. She was using too much GHB, and she could only walk, and she was skinny. She didn't look well at all. So she asked me if I could just buy one more bottle of G, GHB, so that she could start using less and then come off the stuff completely. So I agreed, because she really looked bad. And I told her, but on one condition, that she wouldn't go back to that job again after two days when she feels better. Because it was her birthday two days later. But then, two days later, she did get a call from a client, and she did go to work. And I was very upset again, because I specifically told her that she just shouldn't do that. Anyway, she went to see the client, and she missed an appointment the first day, and then she went again the second day, but she missed the client again, and then the third day she went again, and then finally she got her appointment done. And then she didn't see any more clients for months. And she started trying to get off GHB. And she tried a bunch of times, and then she would fail, and then she tried again, and then she would fail. And we were still having fights, because every now and then she wanted to go see clients again, but then I told her that it's too unsafe for her to go see clients, because she fell asleep on top of some clients, and it could happen that they would take advantage of her. She also just got hit by that guy she was sleeping with. And I was really terrified for her, because it's really not safe doing that job if you're not aware of what's going on around you. And GHB made her so unaware of what's going on around her. Anyway, so one day she did make another booking, but it was to a client's house. And I didn't like it at all. But she went, and we had a big fight before she left. And...Anyway, she went to the client's house, and she only came back the next day. And because I was looking for her, and I couldn't find her, I went into her... Well, she was logged into her Google account on my laptop. So I went into her Google account to find my device, to see if I could find her device, to see where she was, if she was safe or not. But then I found some photos in her Google account of her with a client, where they were both naked and taking photos in a mirror. And usually she wouldn't see clients of different races, because it's just something she didn't do, she didn't feel comfortable. But it was a client of a different race, which you wouldn't usually see as a client. And she also slept with him. She later admitted when I confronted her about the photos, when she finally came back, I confronted her about it, and she said that it was during the time she was at that other guy's house, and she didn't have money, and she was desperate, and she slept with that client as well. Again, that broke my heart again. So it wasn't just that she was sleeping with that guy, she was also sleeping with that client. And that's probably why that... And I thought to myself, that's probably why that other guy beat her up like that, because of what she did. But I wasn't sure, and I still don't know what really happened, and why she was beaten up like that.Anyway, so, um, things settled down again, and because we were fighting so much, she basically told me that if we don't stop fighting by the end of this month, she's going to leave. And I did everything I could to keep calm and to not say anything, but she kept on avoiding any serious conversation about any issues, because by then, the issue was about what happened at the guest house in the beginning of the year. And then, as I found out about the client that she slept with while we were being there, and she went to this client, and she slept over at that client's house, and she didn't tell me what happened and why she didn't come back that same night. So that was also an open issue. And she didn't want to talk about any of that, so I started sending her messages and trying to get her to maybe respond via WhatsApp, but she didn't really want to read anything. So eventually, she went to visit a friend, a girlfriend of hers that she went to for a weekend.
Okay, so eventually she went without GHB for two weeks, and I really thought that was a milestone. One day we were talking again about her job, and we had a fight again, and I told her, listen, I'm not going through this anymore, I don't want this anymore, she's not been taking anything else seriously, she's not been doing any other work seriously, she's not making any money with anything else, even though she could have by then, because by then it's been eight months, and she still hasn't done her online shop, and she still hasn't been selling content, and she hasn't been doing anything from her side, and I've been keeping all my promises, and I've been standing by her all this time, and I've lost two jobs by then, and every time I had to find a new job, and it was just becoming too much for me. I needed to not feel like that anymore, because I was really, I was miserable. I was always worrying about her, and she never wanted to talk to me about anything, I was always unsure about how she felt, and she did tell me once during that time that she loved me, but the next day she forgot she did, because she was on GHB again, and that really made me so confused, because one day she would tell me that she loves me, and the next day she would tell me that she can't even remember saying it. So we had a massive fight, and then eventually she said, no, she'll leave, she'll stop doing that job, she doesn't want to lose me, she's going to stop doing that job completely, she won't ever do it again. And I was so happy that she said that, and even though we had a fight, we forgave each other for that fight and the stuff we said.She was also going to then go to Erica's place. Erica is a woman that she used to work for. She was going to tell her that she's not going to work anymore, and she's closing that door, and that she's putting it behind her. Because they were friends as well, she wanted to go there and say it to her personally. And she was going to go there the Friday night. The strange thing is, she started using GHB again on the Thursday, which I was so sad that she did that. But considering that she's going to stop working, I didn't make a big deal out of it. And I thought that she would be able to leave it this time for sure, because she's not going to see clients anymore, so it would be easier for her to stop using that stuff now. So the Friday night she went to Erica's place, and then she didn't come back until Sunday. And the Saturday when I phoned her, because she took the prepaid electricity cable to recharge money onto the prepaid electricity with her, because it fitted into one of her electronic devices. So I phoned her the Saturday, because the power ran out. I phoned her and I told her, listen, she must bring the cable back, because I need it, because I need to work, I have a deadline. And then she told me that she can't bring it back. And it was really strange, because why wouldn't she be able to bring it back? So I suspect she went with a client that weekend. And she didn't actually go to Erica's. And then Sunday when she came back, she didn't want to say where she was. She said no, she was at Erica's place. But later on I found out that she also got a payment from a client over that weekend. I didn't know it at that stage, but I suspected she was at a client's, because why wouldn't she be able to bring my cable back? She was only close by.So again, we had a fight because she was dishonest. I didn't know what to trust. And then later on, I found WhatsApp messages on her phone where she sent messages to Erica saying that she's not going to stop seeing clients and she's going to keep on seeing four of her regular clients. So we had another fight about that. Then, because the owner kept on hearing our fights, he told us that we must move out. We can't stay there anymore. And because she took my cable that weekend and I couldn't recharge money onto their prepaid, I lost my job because I missed the deadline. So now we had to move and we only had the money coming in for the last two weeks that I still had money, that I was still working. So we have to find a new place. And I was out of income and she also stopped doing her job. So it was really a tough spot. But we found a place and she also told me again that she loved me. And so I thought finally we were going to be happy. But then the day we had to move out, she borrowed money from the one client again. And I gave her R10,000 to pay back all the clients. But then she started borrowing money from the one client again and she also organized to see him again on a booking. We had a fight again. And then finally we moved to a new place. And then the day we moved in there, she also told me again that she thinks that she wants to start doing that job again because she's worried about money. And I told her that every time she does that, every time she keeps on bringing up that job, she hurts me again. And I keep on stressing again and I can't focus on work and it's getting me out of work. And if I can't work then we don't have income. And she was supposed to do her website and her content. And she kept on bringing it up.
And by that stage, I didn't know what to trust anymore. She kept on telling me that she thinks about going back to the job, and she kept on lying to me about speaking to clients. And she was speaking to that guy in Cape Town again, Eugene, as well, and not wanting to say what they were talking about. And she went to stay with Erica again for a weekend. And it was really just going crazy. And the fights just kept on getting worse. And then one night, we had a fight, and she was going to leave. And I told her to just leave the phone that she's got with her, because it was a very expensive phone. It was one of my client's phones. She had another cheaper phone that I told her that she could have. But she left with the expensive phone, and it got stolen. It was 12,000 Rand, gone. She came back later that night after it was stolen. And things were just spiraling. And she was using more GHB than ever. She was fooling around like six hours a day. She was just yelling and making noise and fooling. And I had to help her so that she doesn't hurt herself. I was getting really desperate, because I know I must make money, otherwise she's going to have to go back to that job. But she's keeping me out of work, and she keeps on losing phones and wasting money on GHB. And she also started drinking at this stage to try and use less GHB. She started drinking as well. So now she was drunk and high most of the time. And she broke my laptop one night when I didn't want to give her any more GHB. She threw my laptop out the window. So then I started working on my desktop computer, which was a lot slower. And that didn't have all my work on it. So I had to restart a bunch of stuff that I was busy with for money, which also didn't help. And it just kept on going like that. And one weekend, she went to Hubert's place. So that's the guy that also stayed in the guest house with us. But a year and a half ago, we all three moved in together. So she went for a weekend to Hubert's place.So, she came back on Monday, and things looked to be okay, but then she told me that we must talk, and I had just got a contract from a guy that I needed to get the work done within that week, and I knew that she was going to tell me again that she wanted to go back to doing her job, and I just didn't want to go through that whole fight again, because I needed to keep me from doing my work, and I needed that so that I could start making money to take care of us. So, I told her that if we could maybe talk Friday after work, then I would get paid as well, and then we could finally just relax a bit, and she agreed. And we went through that week mostly without having any fights. But then Thursday, she told me that she was going to go out shopping. She was going to be out for a few hours, but then she didn't return until Sunday, and she went to stay at Erica's place again, the woman that owns the brothel, and she came back with a bunch of money, and she told me during the weekend that she was going to go back to doing the job, and she said, there's nothing I can do, and if I don't like it, then we have to part ways. She also told me two weeks before that, that the whole time since she's been back from Cape Town, the whole ten months we've been back together, that she's been sleeping with two of her clients all the time, with all the bookings that they made. And it was the same, and later on I found out that that's the same guy she slept with when we stayed in Silverton those two times. And it just all felt so shit, because that meant that the reason why we were fighting is because of her conscience probably, because she's been sleeping with two people behind my back for ten months, and the fights just never stopped, and she kept on lying about things. And it must have been that, I knew it must have been that, that must have been the problem. So when she came back on Sunday, I knew she saw that client again, because she wasn't in contact with any other clients anymore, because she hasn't seen any clients for two and a half months then. But she was still in contact with that one guy whose name was Ian. So I knew she slept with him again that weekend, but she forgot that she told me that she'd been sleeping with two clients all year. She told it to me one night when she was using too much GHB again. So she didn't know that I knew that she slept with clients. So I was very upset when she came back, because I knew that that's what happened. And she didn't want to talk about anything, and she kept on telling me things like that. I shouldn't talk with my brain, I should talk with my heart. And she would read the warning labels on the cigarettes and tell me that she hears me, but she's not listening. And she would talk over me, and wouldn't let me say anything. And it kept on going like that for hours. So eventually she sent me a message over WhatsApp, where she told me that she's going to go back to that job. And thanks for being on my journey, she said. Basically dismissing our whole relationship. And she went to bed, and she switched off her phone. She said that I couldn't reply.When she switched off her phone and she didn't want to let me reply, I was really angry by then because by then it's been three hours that she's been dismissing me and not letting me speak and not letting me get a word in. Every time she would say something anI'd want to say something, she would just talk over me and not let me speak. So I woke her up and I told her, listen, I'm going to break your phone if she does stuff like that. If you're just going to message me and then dismiss me like that, I'm just going to break your phone. And it was just to get her attention, just to get her attention so that she would listen to me. Anyway, so she got up and she started pulling my computer screen off my table and she wanted to break that. And I couldn't lose my computer as well because she's already broken my laptop and if I lose that then I can't do any work. So I pushed her back and she fell. She didn't get hurt that much, but she did fall with her back against the side table of her bed it she probably left a mark, I don't know, because that same night she left. After that she kept on throwing stuff around like my computer mouse and stuff like that. She didn't want to stop and she was shouting, hit me, hit me. And I told her that I just wanted the truth from her. I just wanted the truth. And she kept on saying, hit me, hit me. And eventually I just lost it and I hit her once. And when I did that I knew that I did something terrible. And the fighting just stopped. I didn't want to continue fighting anymore. And I didn't even want her there anymore. I told her that she must leave because now I've done something that I've never done in my life and that I felt so ashamed about. And she is the one that brought it out of me. And she kept on lying and she kept on, she just kept on dismissing everything I wanted to say. And since the day she told me that she's going to stop doing that job, she's never been, two weeks that she didn't say that she's going back. And she never, she just started using more drugs and she kept me out of work and she slept with other people and she lied about everything. So I was just sick of it. So I told her that she must leave and she must never, never, ever come back. She must just leave and get out of my life.So, for the first few days after she left, I couldn't reach her. Eventually, after three days, she phoned me and she said that she misses me. We didn't speak much, but I was happy to hear that. And then, a few days later, she was at Hubert's place, the guy that we... that me and her knew from the guesthouse in Silverton. And that she also went to visit two weeks before. And then he told me that... Well, I tried reaching her on his phone because I thought she might be there. And then he replied with a voice note saying that, I'm not Mike and I'm not Erika and I can't intimidate him and stuff like that. But I didn't know what he was talking about. But then it sounded like Nade told him a bunch of stuff about me that wasn't true. And that I was telling people things about her. But it wasn't true. Anyway, so he also told me that he got a lawyer that... that they're going to press charges against me for assault and things like that. So, without me or Nade wanting it Hubert claimed that he got his lawyers involved and now he told her not to speak to me for legal reasons and I couldn't get hold of her at all and she all of a sudden she got stuck on this negative view of me and she didn't want to talk to me at all and she was dismissive and she told me to fuck off and things like that. So weeks went past where I tried to talk to her and eventually she eventually I sent her a message and I told her listen to come get her stuff she can get because she left that day with not much of her stuff so I told her to come get her stuff but then be nice with me and I can go and have some coffee but then she didn't want to or she said he would speak to you because he would need to drive her but then that he didn't want to he didn't want to let her come on her own so of course she kept on then ignoring me again and ignoring me again I told her listen she could either stop paying me back for all the money she owes me which is a lot and I needed some income and or she can treat me like a human being and talk to me and let me get some closure let me know what's going on because is she coming back or not because I still loved her a lot and what we had was I felt like I was just it was just a reaction to what she was kept on doing and finally she was about to leave that job and she could just she could have just closed that door everything would have been fine anyway so she didn't want to speak to me properly and then um the one night we were speaking I was speaking to her again and she told me that she wants to come back so I was very happy and about 20 minutes later she was at my place and she knocked on the door and when I opened the door she and Hubert was there and he pushed me backwards and he pushed himself into my house and he pushed me to the ground and he told and he shouted at her to just grab her stuff so she grabbed her stuff and he kept on like pushing me around and eventually I started shouting help so the neighbors would hear so somebody could just do something um because I was awake for like four days then and I didn't I couldn't defend myself at all and he pushed me to the ground outside and eventually I eventually the neighbors that get in the security company that gets there and I told the security company to get them out of my house and then leave and they let her get the rest of her stuff and I was standing outside speaking to the security and when I went back in I didn't know exactly what they took um because well this whole house was full of stuff so I didn't know what they took um the next day the next morning six o'clock in the morning the owner got there and he told me that I must move out um that I was not welcome anymore because of commotion the previous night. I had nowhere to go and they also stole my phone the previous night. Luckily the owner was nice enough to take me to a nearby guest house. I was also doing work for the owner which I also lost so then I went to a guest house and I had to borrow money from my dad so that I could book into a guest house.
Then I realized that they also took my phone that I then traced to Hubert's house. So, I sent a WhatsApp message from my laptop and I told him to bring back my phone and that I traced to where he stays. So the next day he brought my phone back but then he started blackmailing me with my data he took in the form of 8 computer hard drives drives which I didn't realize until then was gone and he said that if I didn't leave Nade alone that he would give my hard drives to somebody to extort me. All my client data was on the drives, so I couldn't do my job. So for the next few months up until now I've been trying to talk to Nade. I found out since then that Hubert never had lawyers and that he gave Nade false legal advice saying that she's within her right to forcefully get her stuff and to let him in the way she did so that she could grab her stuff.
I don't think she took my hard drives, I'm sure he did, she would not have known what it is and he blackmailed me with that the next day. I've been without a job ever since because I can't do work without my data.
I didn't want to go press charges because I don't want her to get into trouble with him. She is with him now it's been three months now. I figured out that what he was doing was completely manipulative he lied to her about having a lawyer he locked her in a bad mindset of me when he lied about him getting lawyers involved. Then he lied to her and gave her false legal advice to get her to do what she did with getting her stuff and he's been trying to isolate her from me. She started doing her old job again and he tells her everything she wants to hear and he's been playing this really nice character and being acting like he only wants to be a friend but they started sleeping together and it's just heartbreaking because it felt like me and Nade never really had a chance and all the chances we had was always taken from us. So, I started doing some research and I tried to figure out why things happened the way they did. Why this could have... Why this... Why all of this could have happened? Why did it always seem that we kept on fighting and that we couldn't resolve issues and that she would dismiss me like that and stuff like that? And that's when I heard found out about Avoidant Attachment Style. It made so much sense when I read about it and I watched some videos about it. It just made sense. Everything that's been happening. The fact that we stayed in the house we did, and that I was working from home and she was there all the time and she has an Avoidant Attachment Style and I was there all the time. That's why she kept on pushing me away whenever I told her I loved her and that she always did stuff that seemed counterproductive to our relationship. It was just... We were too much in each other's space. And I think if we just knew... If we just knew that there was such a thing as Avoidant Attachment. That's why she didn't always talk to me about stuff and why she shut down every now and then and why she didn't admit the way she felt and things like that. So finally now I know what caused our whole relationship to fail and why we were always fighting about stuff. It was basically just that she needed some space every now and then. And the reason why she didn't commit to a relationship when obviously she told me that she loved me is just because of the same thing. Avoidant Attachment. And the reason why she's not admitting anything now and why she doesn't want to talk to me now is the same reason. And Hubert is manipulating the situation and he is taking advantage of the fact that she's an Avoidant Person.
I think he may be a narcissist, he may have picked up on her Avoidant Tendencies a long time ago and I think because of what happned a year and a half ago when we were all three going to stay together and because he knew her first, I he was always jealous that me and her ended up together. And that's why he tried to get me out of the way like this. He's always been jealous about what happened between me and her because he was away for that time and me and her got a place and he was left without her and he was just resentful. I have to make a decision to go open a case against him at the police or not and just to move on with my life. And I want to write Nade final message or make a video or something where I explain what I've figured out about Avoidant Attachment and that we could have been happy together and there are explanations and it wasn't my or her fault. It was just circumstances and not having the knowledge we should have had made that stuff didn't work out. I just want her to know what was going on so that we can get closure, so that I can get closure and maybe one day when she wants to talk to me again and maybe we can start dating again one day. Because at the moment she just thinks I'm a monster and he has convinced her that I broke her down and I'm a psychopath and things like that. So I just want to get the story straight that Hubert manipulative, that I still care about her and this issue of Avoidant Attachment and that when she one day does forgive me for what happened and I have completely forgiven her, that maybe we could end up together and that she shouldn't have this bad view of me. She doesn't see me for the person I am but for the person that Hubert has made me out to be, and it is not fair that she lives with that view of me and think so little of me because of that lying thieving, manipulative, violent asshole. </p>
