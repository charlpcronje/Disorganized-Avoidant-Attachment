        <h2>Trauma Responses, Not Malice: Why They Behave This Way</h2>

        <p>By now, we've described a number of <em>destructive behaviors</em>: lying, cheating, ghosting friends, picking fights, running from loving partners. It would be easy to villainize someone who does these things. However, a key point must be emphasized: <strong>people with disorganized avoidant attachment are typically not acting out of malice or cold-blooded intent</strong>.</p>

        <p>Rather, they are usually driven by <strong>unconscious trauma responses</strong> – deep-seated fear, shame, and pain that hijack their behavior, often <em>without their full awareness</em>. Understanding this doesn't excuse the harm caused, but it <em>does</em> reframe these individuals not as "bad" or uncaring, but as <em>hurt people who unintentionally hurt others</em> while desperately trying to protect themselves.</p>

                <p>At the core of disorganized attachment is <strong>fear</strong> – primarily fear of abandonment and rejection, but also fear of being emotionally overwhelmed or harmed by closeness. Research has found that many avoidant behaviors are <em>rooted in a fear of abandonment and rejection which manifests as self-sabotage and apparent commitment issues</em><sup>1</sup>.</p>

                <p>In fearful-avoidants, that fear is coupled with an anxious desire for love, creating profound inner turmoil. When a trigger hits – say their partner gets very emotionally close, or conversely, the partner steps away for a day – it can activate what feels like <em>survival terror</em>.</p>

                <p>This is essentially a form of <strong>emotional flashback</strong> to the abandonment or instability they experienced as children. They might not consciously think "I am terrified"; instead it might register as intense anxiety, anger, or an urge to flee.</p>

                 <p>In our story, Nade's pattern of sabotaging closeness (sleeping with clients when the relationship deepened) and her abrupt departures after conflicts (leaving Charl after fights in May 2023 and July 2024) can be seen as fear-driven responses. Charl perceived her actions as hurtful and confusing, but understanding them as stemming from a deep fear of intimacy or abandonment (a trauma response) offers a different perspective than malice.</p>

        <h3>Always Waiting for Abandonment</h3>

        <p>Disorganized attachers often live in a state of constant hypervigilance, always anticipating betrayal or rejection even when things seem fine on the surface<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                <p>One commenter who is an avoidant in therapy shared, <em>"I think a LOT of avoidants truly have a fear of abandonment and rejection which manifests as self sabotage… they do as much as they can to both reel you in and keep you at arm's length… always anticipating when the relationship will end."</em><sup>1, 2</sup></p>

                <p>This highlights how their mind is <em>constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop</em>. Living in that state of hypervigilance (<em>scanning for the first sign of betrayal or rejection</em>) is exhausting, and it causes them to react to <em>anticipated</em> hurts even if nothing bad has happened yet. They might preemptively strike (sabotage) or withdraw because their brain perceives threat in any truly close bond.</p>

                <p>Nade's reluctance to fully commit ("she wouldn't classify it as a relationship," "never wanted to commit") despite expressing love suggests she was anticipating the relationship's end. Her pattern of keeping contact with exes or clients like Ian might have served as an emotional safety net, reflecting a subconscious belief that the primary relationship with Charl was precarious and wouldn't last.</p>

        <h3>The Role of Toxic Shame</h3>

        <p>Another fundamental driver is <strong>shame and a negative self-image</strong>. Disorganized attachers often believe at their core that they are <em>unlovable, broken, or not "enough."</em></p>

                <p>This belief formed in childhood when their emotional needs were not met; a child naturally concludes, <em>"It must be my fault – I'm not lovable or else my parent wouldn't treat me like this."</em> This toxic shame lives on into adulthood.</p>

                <p>Thus, when someone loves them, they <em>cannot fully accept it</em> – they <em>doubt it</em> (thinking "if you really knew me, you wouldn't love me") or feel unworthy of it. One research list of fearful-avoidant traits includes <em>"deep fears of unworthiness or feeling unlovable"</em><sup>1</sup> and a <em>"perpetual negative self-image."</em><sup>2</sup></p>

                <p>With such low self-worth, these individuals might unconsciously sabotage good things because they don't believe they deserve happiness. They may also interpret a partner's needs or complaints as confirmation they are failing. For instance, if a partner says "I feel hurt you didn't call me back," the avoidant is flooded with shame ("I'm a terrible partner, I can't do anything right") which might prompt them to lash out or shut down (a defensive response to that shame).</p>

        <h3>When the Nervous System Takes Over</h3>

        <p><strong>Dissociation and emotional overwhelm</strong> play a role as well. Many disorganized attachers experience moments of emotional dissociation or numbness, especially when their abandonment fears spike<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                <p>They can go into a kind of <em>freeze state</em> where they genuinely feel disconnected from their emotions or the people around them. This might be why some can cut people off so coldly or engage in risky behaviors (like cheating) seemingly without emotion – in those moments, they are <em>not fully present</em>, having detached as a way to cope.</p>

                <p>It's important to note that disorganized attachment is often linked with <strong>C-PTSD (complex trauma)</strong>. In the r/CPTSD forum, many described disorganized attachment as <em>"shapeshifting every time I get a hold of it"</em> and how they can <em>see themselves sabotaging but feel unable to stop, like watching a trainwreck in slow motion</em><sup>1</sup>.</p>

                <p>This suggests a lack of control – their <em>nervous system takes over</em>, driven by old trauma patterns. Because they frequently <em>lack self-awareness in the moment</em>, disorganized avoidants often do not fully realize the damage they're doing until later (if at all). Some will reflect afterwards and deeply regret their actions. A commenter described how “some FAs do tend to realize that they are self-sabotaging… Others may not realize it until later.”<sup>2</sup></p>

        <h3>Fight, Flight, Freeze Responses</h3>

        <p>Disorganized attachers frequently react to relationship stress with primal survival responses: fight, flight, or freeze.</p>

            <talk voice="nova">
                <p>In the thick of an emotional trigger, the fearful-avoidant's <em>fight/flight/freeze</em> response is activated:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fight</strong> (they might start a conflict or blame you)</li>
                    <li><strong>Flight</strong> (ghost you, run away, break up suddenly)</li>
                    <li><strong>Freeze</strong> (shut down emotionally, dissociate)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These are primal reactions, not calculated strategies. For example, an avoidant who storms out during an argument and disappears for days isn't typically trying to punish their partner; more likely, their system felt <em>threatened</em> (by the intensity of the argument or fear of losing the partner) and their impulse was to <em>escape and avoid</em>.</p>

                <p>When confronted about their behavior later, many fearful-avoidants feel genuine confusion or self-justification rather than clear malice. They might say things like, <em>"I don't know why I did that,"</em> or <em>"I just felt trapped,"</em> or <em>"Something in me just flipped."</em> These are signs that their actions were impulsive trauma-driven responses, not a planned betrayal. As one person put it, “We were in distress and we didn’t know why, and we couldn’t do anything about it – our brain did the best it could.”<sup>1</sup> In childhood, those behaviors might have actually been adaptive (e.g., hiding the truth to avoid a parent’s rage, or numbing out to survive abuse). In adulthood, the same behaviors wreak havoc on relationships because the context is different, but the brain is still stuck in “survival mode.”</p>

                <p>In a supportive forum, partners often remind each other that <em>"they're not doing it on purpose to hurt you; they're doing it to protect themselves"</em><sup>1</sup>.

        <h3>Summary: Trauma-Driven Motives</h3>

        <p>Let's break down some common <strong>trauma-driven motives</strong> behind specific behaviors:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lying/omitting</strong> – motive: avoid potential conflict or rejection (if I tell the truth, you'll get mad or leave).</li>
            <li><strong>Cheating</strong> – motive: create distance when feeling too close, or seek validation because feel unlovable (not plotting to betray, but fleeing intimacy or proving one's desirability).</li>
            <li><strong>Ghosting/withdrawing</strong> – motive: overwhelm or fear of saying something "wrong" leads to freeze/flight; also testing if the other will chase (indirectly seeking proof they care).</li>
            <li><strong>Picking fights/blame</strong> – motive: externalize inner turmoil, test the partner's commitment ("will you stay if I behave badly?"), or create justification to flee before they get hurt.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick rebound</strong> – motive: numb heartbreak and shame, regain a sense of being wanted because they feel worthless after a loss.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All of these are <em>protective maneuvers for the psyche</em>. As painful as it is to be on the receiving end, recognizing the pain driving the behavior can foster empathy and point towards the kind of help these individuals need (trauma-focused therapy, compassion, firm boundaries – a mix of understanding and accountability).</p>

        <p>It's also notable that many disorganized attachers truly think <em>something is fundamentally wrong with them</em>. They often experience mental health struggles like depression, anxiety, or even symptoms of borderline personality (identity disturbance, fear of abandonment, emotional ups and downs). This contributes to behaviors because if one believes "I'm broken and will mess this up eventually," it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

                <p>They might sabotage to get the inevitable over with, as strange as that sounds. It's almost <em>easier</em> for them to be in control of the wrecking ball (doing something to ruin things) than waiting in dread for the other person to leave or hurt them. It's that internal narrative – <em>"I'm not worth consistent love"</em> – playing out behaviorally.</p>

                <p>One avoidant person lamented not understanding how they drove their loved one away until it was too late: <em>"I deactivated (withdrew) about 4 months in… As reality sank in and I uncovered my insecure attachment's role – I was rather devastated… I cannot fathom how she can just cut me out entirely… We'd built a lovely connection."</em><sup>1, 2</sup></p>

                <p>Here we see an avoidant who, after the fact, is feeling the pain and confusion of the outcome <em>they themselves set in motion</em>. He "deactivated" (which he now recognizes) and the partner finally left for good; now he is both accepting responsibility and still somewhat in denial ("how can she cut me off?" – not fully grasping that his actions necessitated her protecting herself). This kind of scenario is common: the avoidant is left holding the pieces, wondering how it all fell apart, alternating between blaming themselves and being hurt that the other person walked away. They often *genuinely cared* about that person (disorganized folks can love deeply!), but their defenses won out over their desire for closeness.</p>

                 <p>Nade's repeated sabotage (infidelity, breaking promises) when things seemed stable or were moving forward fits the pattern of a self-fulfilling prophecy. By creating chaos, she ensured the relationship couldn't reach a level of stability that might have triggered her deeper fears of unworthiness or eventual abandonment, thus controlling the "inevitable" breakup on her own terms, even if unconsciously.</p>

        <h3>The Road to Healing</h3>

        <p>In sum, disorganized avoidant behaviors are best understood as <strong>trauma responses</strong>: fight (anger, blame), flight (running away, cheating, leaving first), freeze (stonewalling, dissociating), and even <em>fawn</em> in some cases (over-apologizing or people-pleasing until resentment builds). They cycle through these in relationships.</p>

        <p>These responses were encoded during formative years as survival strategies. Today, they fire off inappropriately in safe relationships because the person has <em>never known real safety</em>.</p>

        <p>It's critical to state: <strong>None of this means one must tolerate abuse or mistreatment</strong> from someone with this attachment style. But seeing the fearful-avoidant as a <em>traumatized person rather than an evil person</em> is important for both parties – it opens the door to healing, accountability, and potentially growth, rather than demonizing and hopelessness.</p>

        <p>Understanding these underlying trauma dynamics is essential for both the person with disorganized attachment and those who care about them. With awareness, commitment to change, and proper therapeutic support, these trauma responses can be healed and healthier relationship patterns can emerge.</p>
