            <i>Hi Nade, ek het hierdie website so paar weke terug begin maark toe ek gesien het dat jy dit nog steeds moeilik vind om te praat oor goed, en ek verstaan dit... Dit is frustrating party keer as ek so graag vir jou iets wil vertel en dit is soveel moeiliker as wat dit kon gewees het, maar dit is hoe jy geleer het om goed te hanteer, en dit is okay. 
            Saam met alles wat ek jou gaan vertel gaan jy ook uitvind dat jy heelwaarskynlik nie BPD het nie en dit is n goeie ding, want BPD gaan nooit weg nie, maar dit wat jy hier gaan leer het nie nodig om weg te gaan nie, maar net dat jy bewus is van dit, dis al, dit is die belangrikste stap.</i>

    <h2>Welcome Nade</h2>
    <talk voice="nova">
    <p>This website is designed to help you understand disorganized avoidant attachment style in a digestible, accessible way. The original research that was done by Charl that was more than twenty two thousand words from beginning to end. Or another way to think about it that it is more than people are required to write to get their doctorate for any given subject. Obviously he did not think you would read all of that so it has been shortened and broken down into pages and sections, with real examples that illustrate key behaviors and patterns.</p>

    <p>What makes this resource unique is that each example includes two perspectives:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research examples</strong> - Examples from the original document based on general research</li>
        <li><strong>Personal examples</strong> - Real situations that demonstrate how these patterns manifested in your actual relationship</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By exploring both the theoretical and the personal, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how disorganized attachment truly operates in daily life.</p>

    <h2>What Is Disorganized Avoidant Attachment?</h2>

    <talk voice="echo">
    <p>Disorganized attachment - often called <strong>fearful-avoidant</strong> in adults - is an attachment style marked by a painful internal conflict. Individuals with this style desperately crave love and connection yet are terrified of intimacy at the same time<sup>1</sup>.</p>

    <p>This attachment style almost always stems from early trauma or inconsistent caregiving in childhood. The child becomes conditioned to "chase" after love but also run from it because the very person they seek safety from is also a source of pain<sup>2</sup>.</p>

                <p>A disorganized/fearful-avoidant person typically has a negative view of self and others. They may feel deeply unworthy of love and assume others will eventually hurt or leave them.<sup>1</sup> Thus, they live in a constant dilemma: yearning for affection and "home" with someone, yet feeling dangerously exposed when intimacy is actually available.<sup>2</sup></p>

                <p>As one individual described it: "I finally want someone to hold me and give me the peace I never felt... and when I do [find someone safe], I run."<sup>3,4</sup></p>

                <h4>When we were still staying at Gert's Guesthouse</h4>

                <p>When we went to speak to Gert for cheaper rooms</p>

                <p>I wanted to explain to him that you needed privacy. But then, without hesitation, you agreed that we should share a room. I could see in youâ€”it was something you truly wanted. But the moment we moved in together, the moment things became closer between us. You started pulling away. And then you went to that booking, you went to see Ian. When you came back you told me that the other girls pressured you into it, you regretted what happened and we held each other and we cried together. I could see it Not because you wanted other men. Not to hurt me. But because being with him made it easier to not feel so close to me. To not feel so emotionally exposed. The fights that followed came from that tension</p>
                
                <p>Those fights made it feel justifiedâ€”for you to take your own room again. And when you finally had that distance, you were back in my room all the time. So much so that I had to ask you to give me time to work. What happened between you and Ian was never really about being with someone else. I understand that now. It was about not wanting to feel that vulnerable. About not wanting to feel like you had that much to lose if I ever walked away.</p>
