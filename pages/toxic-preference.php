        <h2>Feeling Safer in Toxic Relationships Than in Healthy Love</h2>

        <p>One of the most paradoxical (and heartbreaking) patterns of disorganized attachment is that <strong>toxic, unstable relationships often feel "safe" or comfortable to these individuals, while genuinely loving, stable relationships feel unsafe</strong>. This counterintuitive reality is rooted in their early life experiences.</p>

                <p>If someone grew up with abuse or inconsistent care, their nervous system and psyche become <em>adapted to chaos</em>. Chaos, unpredictability, even neglect – these become <em>familiar</em>. On the other hand, <em>stability, kindness, and reliability</em> are utterly foreign and therefore suspect.</p>

                <p>As one survivor of fearful-avoidant attachment explained, <em>"I have such a hard time setting boundaries that if I was dating someone I didn't want to be with, I would essentially make them break up with me… [I was] choosing people who couldn't offer intimacy or were also avoiding it."</em><sup>1</sup></p>

                <p>They went on to realize that, <em>"FAs are more likely to be attracted to people who seem to be not OK in some way (traumatized, stuck, hopeless), because that is what feels familiar, and therefore safe. I'm actually terrified of people who seem to have their shit together, because I feel like they will definitely see me."</em><sup>2</sup></p>

                 <p>Nade's relationship history reflects this. She was involved with Christo, a controlling brothel owner who isolated her and whom she still defends despite his actions. Charl notes, "whenever she speaks about him, she gets very defensive... It's like he can't do anything wrong." Her later involvement with Hubert, who proved manipulative and harmful, further suggests a pattern of being drawn to unhealthy dynamics that may feel familiar, contrasting with the stability Charl offered, which ultimately triggered her avoidance.</p>

        <h3>The "Broken" Finding the "Broken"</h3>

        <p>This powerful testimony shows how a disorganized person might <em>actively seek partners who are wounded or emotionally unavailable</em>. A partner who is "not OK" – say, someone with their own addiction, or who is distant and self-absorbed – resonates with the fearful-avoidant's deep belief about love (that love is painful or people will leave). Such partners <em>confirm their expectations</em>.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, a partner who is emotionally healthy and stable is intimidating because, as the person said, <em>they fear that person will truly <strong>see</strong> them</em> – see their "broken" self that they believe they must hide. A secure, emotionally available partner holds up a mirror that the fearful-avoidant may not be ready to face.</p>

                <p>This dynamic has been observed in research as well. People with fearful-avoidant attachment have a documented <em>"compulsion for choosing dramatic or unhealthy relationships"</em><sup>1</sup>. They often have a <em>history of choosing narcissistic, controlling, or abusive partners</em><sup>2</sup>.</p>

                <p>Nade's consistent withdrawal from Charl, especially during moments of stability or when he showed consistent care ("I was always trying to help her," "I paid her rent"), fits this pattern. The stability Charl offered, despite their conflicts, might have felt more threatening to her than the known dysfunction of past relationships (like with Christo), triggering her fear of being "seen" or becoming dependent.</p>

        <h3>Stability Feels Like a Threat</h3>

        <p>For a disorganized avoidant, the calm of a healthy relationship can actually trigger their deepest fears. What most people consider "green flags" in a relationship, they might experience as warning signs.</p>

                <p>The calm of a healthy relationship actually triggers their deepest fears: <em>"Their 'consistency' will serve as red flags for your subconscious brain,"</em> as one description of the fearful-avoidant mindset put it<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                <p>A securely loving partner might text every day, be open about their feelings, and have solid boundaries. To a healthy person, these are green flags. But to a disorganized avoidant, those very behaviors can set off alarm bells internally: <em>"Why are they so interested in me? What do they want? They'll see I'm not good enough. This feels suffocating."</em></p>

                <p>The <em>absence</em> of chaos feels like the presence of boredom or suffocation, and the reliability feels like an approaching trap (because in childhood, "reliability" was always temporary or a lie before the next abandonment).</p>

                <p>Charl's consistent support and presence, even during Nade's GHB episodes or financial troubles, represented stability. However, Nade often reacted by pushing him away, initiating fights, or stating she needed space right after periods of calm or connection (like Christmas Eve). This suggests the very consistency and reliability Charl offered felt overwhelming or threatening, triggering her avoidant responses.</p>

        <h3>Sabotaging Healthy Connections</h3>

        <p>When a fearful-avoidant does enter a relationship with a securely attached person, they often find ways to sabotage it or view it through a distorted lens.</p>

                <p>Consider a case where a fearful-avoidant man meets a securely attached woman who communicates well and doesn't play games. Initially, he may be overjoyed – <em>"she's so kind and understanding, this is wonderful."</em> But as intimacy grows, that joy turns into anxiety.</p>

                <p>He starts feeling he doesn't deserve her or worries she will demand more emotional openness than he can handle. He might then begin to find reasons why <em>she</em> isn't right for him: <em>"She's too available… maybe we don't have enough chemistry… maybe I actually don't love her as much as I thought."</em> He might even sabotage the relationship by flirting with someone else or withdrawing.</p>

                <p>The secure woman, perplexed, may try harder to reassure him, which paradoxically can make him pull back more. In the end, he may break things off or cause her to end it, and once alone, he concludes, <em>"See, I knew something was off. She wasn't the one."</em> Recall the comment from a Reddit user whose FA ex sabotaged their healthy relationship: "he found the woman he wants a future with but his FA tendencies overtook and sabotaged it for him."<sup>1</sup></p>

        <h3>Choosing Partners Who Will Leave</h3>

                <p>Multiple personal accounts echo this.

You already know how the story ends, so you naturally will choose someone who fits that absent character… that's the type of love you only feel safe enough to accept."</em><sup>1, 2</sup></p>

                <p>This chilling description lays bare the unconscious logic: <em>choose what will hurt you, because it's the devil you know</em>. Indeed, they admitted that if they meet someone special who doesn't trigger that familiar pain, <em>"the second they get too comfortable being with you, too comfortable showing you their affection, their secure love, you run… this type of love… doesn't feel safe enough to have or to hold."</em><sup>3</sup></p>

        <p>Many disorganized attachers describe a kind of addiction to the rollercoaster of unstable relationships. The highs and lows of uncertainty can feel more "real" than steady affection.

                <p>Why would someone leave their caring boyfriend for an ex who gave her breadcrumbs? Why would she remain so attached to an ex who "never had feelings for her" while pushing away a man who treated her well?<sup>1</sup> Likely because the ex replayed her childhood wounds – trying to win over someone distant is a script she knows by heart, one that validates her belief that she's not enough.</p>

                <p>The nice boyfriend, in contrast, offered something she didn't know how to handle: respect, potential commitment, a mirror that said "you are worth it." That might have unconsciously triggered, <em>"No, this can't be right – if he really knew me or if I start depending on him, I'll get hurt worse."</em> So she gravitated back to the toxic dynamic that felt safer. This is also why disorganized attachers can sometimes seem to <em>prefer "bad boys" or "bad girls"</em> – partners who are aloof, moody, or even outright abusive<sup>2</sup>. It's not that they <em>enjoy</em> being mistreated; it's that they are drawn to what aligns with their internal model of relationships. They may also misinterpret the anxiety and intensity of unstable relationships as "passion" or "chemistry."</p>
                <p>One community member with CPTSD and disorganized attachment noted feeling a *“fear and repulsion of anyone who shows a lot of love, even though you wish you could receive it”*<sup>3</sup>.

        <h3>The Toxic Cycle</h3>

        <p>For disorganized avoidants, <strong>dysfunction feels like home</strong>. They feel emotionally safest when the relationship dynamic matches their internal chaos – often that means being with a partner who is unreliable or even hurtful, which validates their belief that love equals pain. Psychologists have pointed out that invalidating childhood environments teach disorganized individuals patterns that later “replay” in their adult relationships<sup>1</sup>.</p>

        <p>Conversely, <em>secure, stable love feels foreign and frightening</em>, frequently leading them to sabotage or flee such relationships. This pattern is not a conscious choice, but an ingrained survival strategy from old trauma. The tragedy is that it <em>reinforces their loneliness</em>: by running from good partners and bonding with harmful ones, they never truly get the love and security they need.</p>

        <p>Recognizing this pattern is a crucial step toward breaking it. With awareness and therapeutic support, it is possible to gradually learn to tolerate healthy love and recognize that stability, not chaos, is the true safety they've been seeking all along.</p>
