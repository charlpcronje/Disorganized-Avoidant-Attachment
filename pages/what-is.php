    <h3>Origins in Childhood</h3>

    <talk voice="echo">
    <p>
        <b>On this page we will get the full view of this attachment style. </b>
        <br/>
        As briefly mentioned on the introduction page this attachment style almost always stems from early trauma or inconsistent caregiving in childhood. Psychologists note that children who develop a disorganized style often come from <em>unpredictable, abusive, or neglectful environments</em><sup>1</sup>. Caregivers may have been a source of both comfort <strong>and</strong> fear – for instance, a parent who sometimes was loving and protective and other times frightening or absent<sup>2</sup>.</p>

        <p>The child becomes conditioned to <em>"chase" after love</em> but also <em>run from it</em> because the very person they seek safety from is also a source of pain<sup>1</sup>. Over time, this results in an internalized belief that <strong>love is unsafe</strong> and <strong>people cannot be trusted</strong>, even as the person longs deeply for attachment.</p>

            <p>Children who experience caregivers who were sometimes loving and other times frightening or absent develop an internal conflict. They learn to both "chase" after love and run from it because they never know if the person they need will be safe or harmful<sup>1</sup>.</p>

            <p>For instance, a child might have a parent who is sometimes warm and affectionate but other times becomes verbally abusive or emotionally absent. This child learns that love is unpredictable and potentially dangerous, yet they can't survive without connection.</p>

            <p>What is known about Nadè's childhood is that she was adopted with her younger brother when she was 4 years old, this is during those 7 critical years. By 4 years old a person's attachment style could have already started being avoidant or fearful. The fact is, is that avoidance feeds avoidance and reinforces itself. So from here onward avoidance of some shape will almost certainly emerge.  </p>

    <h3>Adult Manifestation</h3>

    <talk voice="echo">
    <p>In adulthood, this manifests as the disorganized (fearful-avoidant) attachment pattern: <em>oscillating between high anxiety and high avoidance</em> in close relationships<sup>1</sup>. These individuals experience a deep sense of unworthiness while simultaneously fearing dependency on others.</p>

    <p>A person with this attachment style might desperately want love and connection, but as soon as a relationship starts to feel real, they panic and pull away. They might also stay in unhealthy relationships because the chaos feels more "normal" than steady, reliable love.</p>

        <h2>Ages 1 to 7: Where It Begins</h2>
        <p>
            Between ages 1 and 7, a child's emotional foundation is built. This is the window where
            attachment styles form, shaped by how caregivers respond to the child's needs for comfort,
            safety, and presence.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>60%</strong> of children develop a <strong>secure attachment</strong>, meaning they
            experience caregivers as consistent, warm, and responsive.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>25%</strong> develop an <strong>avoidant attachment</strong>, where emotional needs
            are minimized due to distant or unresponsive caregiving.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>15%</strong> form a <strong>disorganized attachment</strong>—the result of caregiving
            that is inconsistent, frightening, or both. These children internalize confusion: love is
            wanted, but also feared.
            </li>

        <h2>Adulthood and the Impact of the Sex Trade</h2>
        <p>
            In adulthood, especially among women who enter the sex trade through trauma, economic coercion,
            or early boundary violations, we see a pronounced shift. The psychological demands of
            emotionally separating oneself from intimacy—while being physically close—can exacerbate
            disorganized attachment patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            What begins as 15% disorganized in childhood can become <strong>60% or more</strong> among adult
            women in the sex trade.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't about blame—it's about adaptation. These women learn to protect themselves through
            emotional distancing, performance, and control. But the cost is high: their nervous systems
            often remain in survival mode, mistrusting love and fearing vulnerability.

        <h2>The Message Behind the Data</h2>
        <p>
            This visual isn't here to label—it's here to humanize. What looks like detachment is often deep
            pain. What looks like coldness is usually a shield forged in confusion and hurt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every attachment style is adaptive. And every one of them—especially disorganized—can begin to
            heal when met with consistency, safety, and compassion.

                <h2>When Charl and Nade found a Fairy tale</h2>
                <p>From Charl's notes he recalls and describes their time at the cottage that resembled that of a fairy tail as both some of the best and confusing times of his life</p>
                <p>The following is Charl's first person recollection...</p>
                <p>You and I did everything together. And we never fought—not once. If anything ever did bother us, we'd just talk about it and everything was okay again.We were good for each other and even back then I knew you felt more for me than you were willing to admit. Then we found the Fairy Tale cottage. It was perfect for us—exactly what we needed at that point. It felt right.</p>
                
                <p>But just as we finally found a place to settle, a space where we could actually start building something real together—that's when things changed. That's when the relationship started to feel *real*, and you didn't want to feel too invested. So you did things, you went to see Ian again 3 times in November. I'm not going to say anything more about that now, because this isn't about that. But what matters is: you started creating distance. You said things like "we're just friends." And not long after, the fighting started.</p>
                
                <p>It's strange… because those fights gave you peace. The distance it created made you calm again. Then in December, the fighting completely stopped. Until Christmas Eve. That night, you and I sat together, laughing about how we were fighting. We couldn't even believe it. It felt like ancient history and I did not think it would be possible for us to do that again.</p>
                
                <p>Neither of us knew that moment—where we saw again how happy we actually were—would trigger your fear all over again. The next day, you went to see a client again, I'm not sure which one or what happened but we had that huge fight. You told me you needed space, and I didn't understand it.</p>

    <h3>Summary: A Complex Pattern</h3>

    <talk voice="echo">
    <p>In summary, a disorganized/fearful-avoidant attachment style involves:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A painful internal conflict between craving and fearing intimacy</li>
        <li>Origins in unpredictable or traumatic childhood experiences</li>
        <li>A negative view of both self ("I'm unworthy") and others ("People will hurt me")<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>Inconsistent behavior in relationships (pursuing then withdrawing)</li>
        <li>Difficulty with emotional regulation in close relationships</li>
        <li>A tendency to sabotage relationships when they become too intimate</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding this attachment style is the first step toward healing. By recognizing these patterns, both those who have this attachment style and their loved ones can begin to make sense of seemingly contradictory behaviors and work toward more secure relationships.</p>
