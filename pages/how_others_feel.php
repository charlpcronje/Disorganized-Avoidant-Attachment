        <h2>How Survival Rewrites the Self - The Invisible Shift</h2>
        <p>Disorganized attachers don't always have a clear internal compass. That's not their fault. When someone grows up in chaos or unpredictability, their sense of right and wrong becomes relational—not internal. This means they learn to survive by scanning the room, watching how others react, and adapting accordingly. If the people around them say something is fine, they start to believe it is.</p>
        <p>This isn't manipulation. It's not even conscious. It's what the nervous system does when it doesn't know what's safe or what's not. It's why a person can end up doing things they never imagined—not because they changed their values, but because the environment changed their mirrors. And when the mirror changes, the reflection does too.</p>

                <p>Psychologists have long documented how people adjust their moral behavior depending on group norms. In one study, participants who were surrounded by peers breaking rules were more likely to break rules themselves, even if they initially resisted. This effect was amplified in those with trauma backgrounds, especially those with fearful or disorganized attachment styles.</p>
                <p>They didn't do it because they wanted to. They did it because the environment made them feel like it was “just how things are.” For disorganized individuals, the line between influence and identity is incredibly thin.</p>

                <p>But I know—and I think you do too—that there have been times where your environment made you forget who you were. Where things happened that left you feeling hollow or ashamed. Times where you walked away from a moment and just hated that it ever happened at all. And it wasn't because it was what you wanted. It's because you adapted. You did what your attachment system normalized for you to survive. And that version of you wasn't really you—you were in survival mode.</p>

                <p>In trauma research, it's well documented that individuals with insecure or disorganized attachment patterns often suppress their emotional responses in order to maintain a sense of control. In one study on adult attachment, participants with high attachment anxiety or avoidance were shown emotionally charged images. Their physiological responses (heart rate, cortisol, etc.) spiked, but their expressive behavior remained muted.</p>
                <p>This tells us something critical: just because someone looks calm on the outside, doesn't mean they aren't experiencing inner chaos. In fact, many disorganized attachers learn early on that showing emotion can make things worse—so they bury it, hoping it will stay quiet. But buried pain always leaks somewhere. Usually in places they least expect, or in ways they don't recognize as trauma.</p>

                <p>Psychologists often refer to anger as a “secondary emotion.” That means it usually covers up something deeper—often fear, shame, or helplessness. In attachment trauma, this is especially true. A parent or partner may yell not because they're violent, but because they feel a deep terror of losing someone they love, and they don't know how to express it any other way.</p>
                <p>One study found that individuals with unresolved trauma often used anger to regulate overwhelming emotions. Not because they were abusive—but because they didn't feel safe enough to be vulnerable. For disorganized attachers, anger can actually be a desperate attempt at connection—masked as rejection.</p>

                <p>Ask yourself... Why do mothers always first get angry at their child when they got lost, or drifted off and then when she turns around their child is gone. Why aren't they immediately not just happy when they find them.</p>
                <p>Well if would be very useless when the child is lost if his mother just started crying and did nothing to find them... So anger is what stops sadness when it is not yet time to be sad, when you feel that it is not yet time to be sad, when crying will be counter productive to the immediate situation.</p>
                <p>So.. When the mother finds her child she is angry, because she wants to make sure the danger is over and to make sure, or at least to try and tell the child in a way they understand and not forget, she talks loudly and with anger to her child too. Not because she hates her child, but because she loves her child more than anything, and she wants to make sure the child does not forget.</p>
                <p>So when I said the things I did, it was not to hurt you or to break you down. And it was not because I loved you less or because I saw you as less. It was because I wanted to make you understand and never forget, because I did not want to lose you to that dark world.</p>

                <p>Modern neuroscience has shown that humans possess mirror neurons—brain cells that fire both when we perform an action and when we observe someone else doing the same. These neurons play a key role in empathy, learning, and especially behavioral adaptation.</p>
                <p>In environments where risky, numbing, or self-destructive behavior is normalized, mirror neurons can reinforce those actions as "acceptable," even when they conflict with our values. This is amplified in those with attachment trauma, who are already scanning the environment for cues on how to survive. In short, your nervous system learns from the room—even when your heart disagrees.</p>

He told me that she was there for the Christmas party and she was in a room with 10 men all night. All of them used her, and when they were done with her, they stole her clothes and money and left her broken on the floor. They found her two days later still lying there, not knowing what to do or how to deal with what happened. The manager said that when he gave her clothes, she did not say anything—she just ran away.</p>

                <p>The "sunk cost fallacy" is a well-known psychological pattern where people continue investing in something—time, energy, relationships—not because it's working, but because they've already invested so much.

                <p>For disorganized attachers, this creates a dangerous loop: the more they give to something painful, the more they need it to succeed—just to avoid collapsing under the weight of regret.

There was a time where I could not tell any of these stories without it making me very upset and it would certainly have left me in tears.</p>

                <p>So I wrote down what I felt and why I felt the way I did. Sometimes more than once and in different ways. Sometimes I would write it down as a message to someone or even to myself. That did help, in fact it helped more than I think. The things I kept writing down was mostly what I blamed myself for. It took a while of writing everything down before I realised that it was not my fault, it took me a while to find the words so that I could forgive myself and to be honest where I did make mistakes, and also to blame the people that must be blamed for the rest. Those things that I write down is what kept me from losing myself, because I could go back and see who I was and what I was losing and I could find my way back.</p>

        <p>What I'm scared of now… is that if you keep using a distorted mirror for too long, one day you might stand in front of a real one—and not recognize yourself anymore. Not because you've become someone bad. But because you've been reflecting back the wrong image for so long, it starts to feel real.</p>

        <p>That's what those places do. They don't just numb you—they reshape you, slowly, quietly, without asking permission. And when the shaping is done, it gets harder to remember what your face used to look like when it was only yours, untouched by pressure, unfiltered by survival.</p>

        <p>But no matter how long it's been, I believe the real reflection is still in there. The one that isn't shaped by survival. The one that didn't need to adapt to be enough.</p>

        <h3>When Boundaries Feel Optional</h3>
        <p>One of the hardest things about being disorganized is that you don't always feel the line when it's being crossed. Not because you don't care. But because your system is so used to keeping you safe by blending in, by not making a scene, by avoiding judgment. So if everyone else is doing something, and no one is reacting badly to it, then your body assumes: it must be okay. You start telling yourself “I guess this is normal.”</p>
        <p>But the truth is—just because the room accepts something, doesn't mean it's right. Just because no one else says “this hurts” doesn't mean it's painless. Sometimes, the fact that no one's reacting is the loudest red flag of all. Because the mirror's gone quiet. And when you can't hear your reflection, it's easy to forget who you were.</p>

        <p>You don't have to confront anyone. You don't have to explain yourself. But if you ever feel the shift—if the room starts to shape you in a way that makes you feel smaller, colder, or less alive—it's okay to question it. It's okay to pause. To step back. To say, “this isn't me.”</p>

        <p>You don't have to know where you're going. You just have to remember where you came from—and that there's a version of you that still exists, even if no one around you sees her right now. You are still her. You haven't disappeared. You're just waiting to be remembered.</p>

        <h3>Update 23rd April 2025</h3>
        <p>Make sure you listen to the page above first.</p>
        <p>I hope you understand why I asked you to look at this page now. It feels to me that you have been doing things for a long time and just always expecting your nervous system and psychological health to just take the hit.</p>

        <p>In the end, all that we are and all that we have is our health, sanity, and the ability to connect. If you carelessly damage who you are because it is convenient now, then you might regret it later. The worst thing is that you won't even know you are missing parts of yourself when they are made to hide themselves or are taken from you.</p>

        <p>When I was at my parents' house this past weekend, and I was speaking to my mother, who is now at stage 6 Alzheimer's—she's got no idea she's got Alzheimer's. She's got absolutely no idea. And I can't tell her because she'll just forget it again. And the things that she's missing, the parts of her that she's missing, she doesn't know that. She doesn't know that she's missing parts of herself. She doesn't know she's not remembering parts of herself. She doesn't—she's got no idea. It feels strange to even think that that's possible. But the things that she doesn't remember, she doesn't know that they ever existed. And that's exactly what happens if you put yourself through the things that you have enforced. You lose things that you might never have even noticed were gone. I think you can still get them—it's not that you can never get them back. But if you don't give yourself a chance to, then you might never. And that's not worth it.</p>

        <p>So, the reason for this last addition to this page is: don't just do something because it is where you are, or it's easy, or it's convenient. It's not worth it. I will pay for you—for a place where it's safe and where people have—where you can be you and not be forced to be someone you are not and not be expected to be something you are not, and where you won't look back one day and not even remember where you lost what made you so special in the first place.</p>

        <p>I think that I have not expressed myself correctly in the past, and you felt that I wanted to change you.</p>

        <p>Here is an easy way to get what I am trying to say now, that you should never forget: treat yourself like you are someone you care for. People don't do that—they don't treat themselves as someone they care for. Let's compare this to the story of the mother and the child from before. Treat yourself like a mother would treat her daughter. Take care of yourself and become aware of the fact that you are important to people, and to yourself, and to me. If you could only see yourself as I do, then you would not think that I am judging or being overprotective. Point being, if you start treating yourself like you are someone you care about, then you will feel that, and you will be able to feel that more and more easily for other people too.</p>

It is about a year now since I last saw you, it has been about a year of you doing what you did for most of the time we were together and what you did when you and Mike broke up and when you and Christo broke up and when you left Cape Town and told me you don't want to do that any more. Today I am not asking you to leave that job, I am ask you to preserve yourself, do not let your environment become what is changing you. If you make changes then make deliberate changes, to things that matter to you. When last did you change something in your life that you wanted to be different and not just lived with how things are because they changed without you askking for it but it happened anyway.
