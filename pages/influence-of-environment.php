                <p>Psychologists have long documented how people adjust their moral behavior depending on group norms. In one study, participants who were surrounded by peers breaking rules were more likely to break rules themselves, even if they initially resisted. This effect was amplified in those with trauma backgrounds, especially those with fearful or disorganized attachment styles.</p>

                <p>In trauma research, it's well documented that individuals with insecure or disorganized attachment patterns often suppress their emotional responses in order to maintain a sense of control. In one study on adult attachment, participants with high attachment anxiety or avoidance were shown emotionally charged images. Their physiological responses (heart rate, cortisol, etc.) spiked, but their expressive behavior remained muted.</p>
                <p>This tells us something critical: just because someone looks calm on the outside, doesn't mean they aren't experiencing inner chaos. In fact, many disorganized attachers learn early on that showing emotion can make things worse—so they bury it, hoping it will stay quiet. But buried pain always leaks somewhere. Usually in places they least expect, or in ways they don't recognize as trauma.</p>

                <p>Yes, I reacted badly. I said things in anger and sadness. That was my pain showing, and I wish I could take it back.</p>
                <p>I know those words hurt you, but they weren't how I ever saw you. They were my fear and panic because of my wounds. I have been through some things, just like you have been, and you have to respect that, it does not help anyone if you tell me that I'm obviously not ready for X and Y because I have also had a life. After what happened between us, I knew that there were some things that I did not understand</p>

        <p>The way I see you has always become better and with more love. The things that happened, that might have changed how you have seen yourself at times, had never changed the way I see you. I have never doubted who you are, and when you did things that seemed out of character, it did not make me see you as less.</p>

        <p>No, I went and I found the reasons for it because I knew there had to be one, and when I did, I respected you even more. So, how I see you has changed, but never as less, because I know who you are and I have always seen that.</p>

        <h3>When Boundaries Feel Optional</h3>
        <p>One of the hardest things about being disorganized is that you don't always feel the line when it's being crossed. Not because you don't care. But because your system is so used to keeping you safe by blending in, by not making a scene, by avoiding judgment. So if everyone else is doing something, and no one is reacting badly to it, then your body assumes: it must be okay. You start telling yourself “I guess this is normal.”</p>
        <p>But the truth is—just because the room accepts something, doesn't mean it's right. Just because no one else says “this hurts” doesn't mean it's painless. Sometimes, the fact that no one's reacting is the loudest red flag of all. Because the mirror's gone quiet. And when you can't hear your reflection, it's easy to forget who you were.</p>
