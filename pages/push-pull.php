    <h2>The Push-Pull Cycle: Craving Love and Then Withdrawing</h2>

    <p>One hallmark of disorganized attachment is the <strong>push-pull cycle</strong> - an intense pattern of pursuit and retreat that can be bewildering to partners, friends, and family. In romantic relationships, a fearful-avoidant might initially come on very strong, showering a new partner with attention and affection (the "honeymoon" phase of their anxious side). They crave the connection and may even talk about future plans quickly.</p>

    <p>However, as soon as the relationship starts to feel "real" or the partner opens up emotionally, panic sets in.</p>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research" style="display: block;">
            <p>An individual described how as soon as he showed vulnerability, his fearful-avoidant girlfriend started to withdraw, even though things had been going great <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Fast%20forward%20a%20couple%20of,stressed%20with%20work%20and%20sick" target="_blank"><sup>(For those who've been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps)</sup></a>. When he gently asked if something was wrong, she denied it and gave a superficial excuse, saying she was just stressed with work and feeling sick <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Fast%20forward%20a%20couple%20of,stressed%20with%20work%20and%20sick" target="_blank"><sup>(For those who've been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps)</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>In reality, the intimacy triggered her deep fear - but instead of expressing this, she pulled away emotionally. This kind of sudden distancing is common: the fearful-avoidant flips into "avoidant mode," appearing to go cold, silent, or busy as a way to manage the overwhelm of closeness.</p>

            <p>Often, the partner on the receiving end has no idea what caused the shift. In the above case, just weeks later the girlfriend abruptly dumped her boyfriend via text, saying she needed to "sort out her emotions" about an ex <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Fast%20forward%20two%20weeks%20later,don%E2%80%99t%20want%20to%20trigger%20anyone" target="_blank"><sup>(For those who've been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps)</sup></a>. The breakup was handled insensitively (a text message with little explanation), which is another pattern - disorganized attachers may end relationships in an avoidant, hasty way to escape the anxiety they feel, without fully considering the partner's feelings. The boyfriend later discovered that **she had been maintaining contact with an ex** behind his back; she admitted she'd been “hung up on this guy for a year and a half”, even while dating him <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Her%20text%20said%20that%20she%E2%80%99d,claimed%20she%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20pursing%20him" target="_blank"><sup>(For those who've been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps)</sup></a>.</p>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal">
            <p>Our story vividly shows this. When Nade returned from Cape Town in October 2023, the first month was described as "perfect," filled with connection and intimacy ("everything was going great... we were more intimate than ever"). 
            </br></br>    
            However, as the relationship solidified and Charl likely expressed deeper commitment, Nade began seeing her client Ian again in November. This coincided exactly with when "the fighting started." Her return to seeing a client she slept with acted as a way to create emotional distance and sabotage the deepening intimacy, fitting the pattern of withdrawing after a honeymoon phase.</p>
        </div>

    <h3>Hot and Cold Behavior in Friendships</h3>

    <p>For friends and family, the push-pull may look like hot and cold behavior or outright vanishing acts. A person with disorganized attachment might be the life of the party one month and then ghost their close friends for weeks or months for no clear reason.</p>

    <div class="example-container" id="example-friendship-ghosting">
        <div class="example-header">
            <h3 class="example-title">Example: Ghosting Close Friends</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="tabs-wrapper">
            <button class="tab-btn active" data-tab="research">Research Example</button>
            <button class="tab-btn" data-tab="personal">Personal Example</button>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research" style="display: block;">
            <p>As one individual with this style confessed, "It's intentionally losing contact with really good friends, never calling or texting, but constantly craving their validation/attention... and then being bitter about it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/xre1nh/what_does_disorganised_attachment_feel_like_to_you/#:~:text=It%27s%20intentionally%20losing%20contact%20with,then%20being%20bitter%20about%20it" target="_blank"><sup>(what does disorganised attachment feel like to you? : r/CPTSD)</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>In other words, they deeply want connection with their friends, but fear or inertia stops them from reaching out, so they wait and wait for the friend to initiate - sometimes indefinitely - and grow resentful or hurt when the friend doesn't. They often feel safer interacting with strangers superficially than with people who truly know them <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/xre1nh/what_does_disorganised_attachment_feel_like_to_you/#:~:text=Feeling%20more%20comfortable%20interacting%20with,relationships%20in%20your%20own%20life" target="_blank"><sup>(what does disorganised attachment feel like to you? : r/CPTSD)</sup></a>, because casual interactions carry no intimacy demands.</p>

            <p>Another person reflected on this pattern, saying they had a clear history of "intentionally losing contact for no reason and then just feeling horrible and lonely and guilty" afterwards <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/xre1nh/what_does_disorganised_attachment_feel_like_to_you/#:~:text=This%20is%20too%20real,horrible%20and%20lonely%20and%20guilty" target="_blank"><sup>(what does disorganised attachment feel like to you? : r/CPTSD)</sup></a>. This cycle of isolating oneself, yet feeling upset about the resulting isolation, is a self-imposed push-pull in friendships.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal" style="display: none;">
            <p>While the story focuses on the romantic relationship, Nade's pattern with Charl reflects this. They started as close friends who shared everything ("we spoke for months and months"). However, when conflicts arose or intimacy deepened (like Charl saying "I love you"), she would withdraw emotionally, sometimes ignoring messages for extended periods (Charl mentions waiting six months for her to read his messages) or avoiding difficult conversations altogether, leaving Charl feeling isolated and confused despite their initial closeness.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>On-Again, Off-Again Relationships</h3>

    <p>In romantic contexts, the push-pull frequently escalates to an on-and-off relationship dynamic. The fearful-avoidant may break up when intimacy scares them, only to feel regret and loneliness once the partner is gone - and then attempt to reconnect.</p>

    <div class="example-container" id="example-breakup-return">

            <h3 class="example-title">Example: Breaking Up and Attempting to Return</h3>

        <div class="tabs-wrapper">
            <button class="tab-btn active" data-tab="research">Research Example</button>
            <button class="tab-btn" data-tab="personal">Personal Example</button>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research" style="display: block;">
            <p>One Reddit user described an ex who "came on really strong in the beginning" and both partners fell hard, but "as soon as things got real, he doubted his feelings and started taking things back," leading to a breakup before it even became official <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Oh%2C%20funny%20to%20find%20this,breaking%20up%20before%20defining%20things" target="_blank"><sup>(For those who've been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps)</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>A month later, that same ex tried to come back, clearly feeling the loss, but when rebuffed, he disappeared - only to reach out again months after that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=things" target="_blank"><sup>(For those who've been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps)</sup></a>. This yo-yo behavior is classic for disorganized attachers: their anxious side misses the person intensely once alone, while their avoidant side can't sustain the intimacy.</p>

            <p>The result is a rollercoaster of break-ups, make-ups, or attempts to rekindle. Each reunion may be heartfelt, but without healing, the cycle usually repeats as soon as stability is re-established.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal" style="display: none;">
            <p>Our story includes a clear example of this. Nade left Charl after a major fight in May 2023 ("she left... And I didn't see her again for six months"). For six months, she was distant. Then, after finally reading his messages and reflecting, she contacted him, "she said sorry for everything... And we sort of made up," and returned to Pretoria. This mirrors the cycle where the avoidant leaves due to fear but later attempts to return when feelings of loss surface. Her final departure in July 2024 also showed initial regret ("she found me and she said that she misses me" three days later) before external manipulation solidified the separation.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>The Internal Experience</h3>

    <p>The internal experience driving this push-pull is often described as living with constant ambivalence and anxiety. The person is locked in a battle between attachment and fear.</p>

    <div class="example-container" id="example-internal-conflict">
        <div class="example-header">
            <h3 class="example-title">Example: The Internal Battle</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="tabs-wrapper">

            <button class="tab-btn" data-tab="personal">Personal Example</button>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research" style="display: block;">
            <p>As one person with disorganized attachment shared, "I finally want someone to hold me and give me the peace I never felt... and when I do [find someone safe], I run." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HealMyAttachmentStyle/comments/1cxw7xz/in_the_mind_of_an_fearful_avoidant_disorganized/#:~:text=And%20with%20all%20this%20fear%2C,you%20that%20wants%20a%20home" target="_blank"><sup>(In the Mind of An Fearful Avoidant/ Disorganized Attachment Style : r/HealMyAttachmentStyle)</sup></a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HealMyAttachmentStyle/comments/1cxw7xz/in_the_mind_of_an_fearful_avoidant_disorganized/#:~:text=Or%20in%20some%20cases%20you,You%20are%20not%20worth%20it" target="_blank"><sup>(In the Mind of An Fearful Avoidant/ Disorganized Attachment Style : r/HealMyAttachmentStyle)</sup></a></p>

            <p>They explained that when a partner shows consistent affection and stability - the very things they thought they wanted - it "doesn't feel safe" to them <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HealMyAttachmentStyle/comments/1cxw7xz/in_the_mind_of_an_fearful_avoidant_disorganized/#:~:text=Or%20in%20some%20cases%20you,You%20are%20not%20worth%20it" target="_blank"><sup>(In the Mind of An Fearful Avoidant/ Disorganized Attachment Style : r/HealMyAttachmentStyle)</sup></a>. It actually triggers panic, because deep down they "believe no one will be there" for them or that they are "not enough" to keep the love <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HealMyAttachmentStyle/comments/1cxw7xz/in_the_mind_of_an_fearful_avoidant_disorganized/#:~:text=Over%20and%20over%20again%2C%20,most%2C%20because%20they%20never%20did" target="_blank"><sup>(In the Mind of An Fearful Avoidant/ Disorganized Attachment Style : r/HealMyAttachmentStyle)</sup></a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HealMyAttachmentStyle/comments/1cxw7xz/in_the_mind_of_an_fearful_avoidant_disorganized/#:~:text=that%27s%20the%20type%20of%20love,And%20the%20cycle%20repeats" target="_blank"><sup>(In the Mind of An Fearful Avoidant/ Disorganized Attachment Style : r/HealMyAttachmentStyle)</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>Thus, they might initiate a fight, disappear for a while, or find some reason to create distance, even though it hurts them too. Loved ones on the outside see the confusing behavior (one moment needy, next moment detached), but internally the person is locked in a battle between attachment and fear.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal" style="display: none;">
            <p>Nade's actions consistently showed this conflict. She desired closeness with Charl ("she also told me again that she loved me," "she misses me," wanting to come back) but repeatedly sabotaged it (sleeping with clients, lying, pushing him away, breaking promises like stopping work). Charl notes, "It's like every single time she does anything that moves her forward... then it is like it is so uncomfortable that she simply has to sabotage it." Her inability to fully commit despite expressing love illustrates the internal battle between wanting connection and fearing the vulnerability it entails.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Understanding the Push-Pull Pattern</h3>

    <p>The push-pull pattern often leaves partners, friends, and family members confused and hurt. It's important to understand that this behavior isn't typically deliberate manipulation - it's a trauma response based on conflicting needs for both connection and safety.</p>

    <p>For the disorganized individual, intimacy represents both what they desperately want and what terrifies them most. Each approach toward closeness activates their attachment system (wanting connection) while simultaneously triggering their fear response (anticipating hurt or abandonment).</p>

    <p>This internal tug-of-war manifests externally as inconsistent behavior toward loved ones, creating an unpredictable relationship experience for all involved.</p>
