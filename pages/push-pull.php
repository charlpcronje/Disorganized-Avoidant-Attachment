        <h2>The Push-Pull Cycle: Craving Love and Then Withdrawing</h2>

        <p>One hallmark of disorganized attachment is the <strong>push-pull cycle</strong> - an intense pattern of pursuit and retreat that can be bewildering to partners, friends, and family. In romantic relationships, a fearful-avoidant might initially come on very strong, showering a new partner with attention and affection (the "honeymoon" phase of their anxious side). They crave the connection and may even talk about future plans quickly.</p>

        <p>However, as soon as the relationship starts to feel "real" or the partner opens up emotionally, panic sets in.</p>

                <p>An individual described how as soon as he showed vulnerability, his fearful-avoidant girlfriend started to withdraw, even though things had been going great<sup>1</sup>. When he gently asked if something was wrong, she denied it and gave a superficial excuse, saying she was just stressed with work and feeling sick<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                <p>In reality, the intimacy triggered her deep fear - but instead of expressing this, she pulled away emotionally. This kind of sudden distancing is common: the fearful-avoidant flips into "avoidant mode," appearing to go cold, silent, or busy as a way to manage the overwhelm of closeness.</p>

                <p>Often, the partner on the receiving end has no idea what caused the shift. In the above case, just weeks later the girlfriend abruptly dumped her boyfriend via text, saying she needed to "sort out her emotions" about an ex<sup>1</sup>. The breakup was handled insensitively (a text message with little explanation), which is another pattern - disorganized attachers may end relationships in an avoidant, hasty way to escape the anxiety they feel, without fully considering the partner's feelings. The boyfriend later discovered that <strong>she had been maintaining contact with an ex</strong> behind his back; she admitted she'd been “hung up on this guy for a year and a half”, even while dating him<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                <p>Our story vividly shows this. When Nade returned from Cape Town in October 2023, the first month was described as "perfect," filled with connection and intimacy ("everything was going great... we were more intimate than ever").
                </br></br>
                However, as the relationship solidified and Charl likely expressed deeper commitment, Nade began seeing her client Ian again in November. This coincided exactly with when "the fighting started." Her return to seeing a client she slept with acted as a way to create emotional distance and sabotage the deepening intimacy, fitting the pattern of withdrawing after a honeymoon phase.</p>

        <h3>Hot and Cold Behavior in Friendships</h3>

        <p>For friends and family, the push-pull may look like hot and cold behavior or outright vanishing acts. A person with disorganized attachment might be the life of the party one month and then ghost their close friends for weeks or months for no clear reason.</p>

                <p>As one individual with this style confessed, "It's intentionally losing contact with really good friends, never calling or texting, but constantly craving their validation/attention... and then being bitter about it."<sup>1</sup></p>

                <p>In other words, they deeply want connection with their friends, but fear or inertia stops them from reaching out, so they wait and wait for the friend to initiate - sometimes indefinitely - and grow resentful or hurt when the friend doesn't. They often feel safer interacting with strangers superficially than with people who truly know them<sup>2</sup>, because casual interactions carry no intimacy demands.</p>

                <p>Another person reflected on this pattern, saying they had a clear history of "intentionally losing contact for no reason and then just feeling horrible and lonely and guilty" afterwards<sup>3</sup>. This cycle of isolating oneself, yet feeling upset about the resulting isolation, is a self-imposed push-pull in friendships.</p>

                <p>While the story focuses on the romantic relationship, Nade's pattern with Charl reflects this. They started as close friends who shared everything ("we spoke for months and months"). However, when conflicts arose or intimacy deepened (like Charl saying "I love you"), she would withdraw emotionally, sometimes ignoring messages for extended periods (Charl mentions waiting six months for her to read his messages) or avoiding difficult conversations altogether, leaving Charl feeling isolated and confused despite their initial closeness.</p>

    <h3>On-Again, Off-Again Relationships</h3>

    <p>In romantic contexts, the push-pull frequently escalates to an on-and-off relationship dynamic. The fearful-avoidant may break up when intimacy scares them, only to feel regret and loneliness once the partner is gone - and then attempt to reconnect.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the Push-Pull Pattern</h3>

        <p>The push-pull pattern often leaves partners, friends, and family members confused and hurt. It's important to understand that this behavior isn't typically deliberate manipulation - it's a trauma response based on conflicting needs for both connection and safety.</p>

        <p>For the disorganized individual, intimacy represents both what they desperately want and what terrifies them most. Each approach toward closeness activates their attachment system (wanting connection) while simultaneously triggering their fear response (anticipating hurt or abandonment).</p>

        <p>This internal tug-of-war manifests externally as inconsistent behavior toward loved ones, creating an unpredictable relationship experience for all involved.</p>
