    <h2>Lies, Deflection, and Blaming Loved Ones</h2>

    <p>To cope with their intense fear of intimacy and the shame they carry, disorganized avoidants often resort to <strong>dishonesty and deflection</strong>. Importantly, these are usually <em>reflexive, unconscious tactics</em> - not calculated manipulation. The person is often <em>not fully aware</em> that they are lying or shifting blame; they are instinctively trying to protect themselves from emotional discomfort or perceived danger. This can manifest as withholding information, making excuses, or even gaslighting-type behaviors (unintentionally) when confronted about their withdrawal or other hurtful actions.</p>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research">
            <p>When a partner or friend senses something is wrong and asks about it - the fearful-avoidant will <em>deny their true feelings</em> and give a plausible external explanation. For example, when a boyfriend noticed his disorganized-attached girlfriend was distancing herself, she <strong>insisted nothing was wrong</strong>, blaming stress at work or feeling ill <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Fast%20forward%20a%20couple%20of,stressed%20with%20work%20and%20sick" target="_blank"><sup>(For those who've been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps)</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>This was a deflection; in reality, she was emotionally shutting down out of fear, but by <em>shifting the focus to work</em> she avoided a vulnerable conversation about her anxiety. Disorganized individuals often become adept at such **excuse-making**. They might cancel plans citing a headache when actually they felt too emotionally close and panicked. They might say “I've just been busy” when they haven't answered texts, when in truth they were avoiding attachment triggers. These little lies are a way to maintain distance without directly confronting the issue.</p>

            <br>Toe ek jou leer ken het einde 2022 / begin 2023 tot en met jy weg was by Silverton. In daai 5-6 maande het jy net twee bookings gedoen. Dis is nie dat jy nie meer afsprake gehad het nie, maar jy was of elke keer laat of die klient het nie opgedaag nie of iets het gebeur dat die booking nooit gebeur het nie. Dit was ook nie dat ek jou terug gehou het nie. Ek weet nie hoeveel keer ek vir jou drank winkel toe gehardloop het omdat jy nie 'n klient nugter wou sien nie.
            </br></br>
            Die kwee keer wat jy wel na booking toe was, was dit ablei kere ook met Ian gewees. Ek het dit obviously nie toe geweet nie. Ek kan nie seker wees oor jou eerste afspraak met hom nie, ek glo actually nie dat jy gedink het dit so ver sou gaan niem, want toe jy terug gekom het, toe het di regtig gelyk of jy nie so goed doen nie.
            </br></br>
            Toe later het ons saam in die boonste kamer in gettrek, en ons het die eerste keer saam geslaap. Toe net n paar dae later toe was jy na daai afspraak toe by jou vriendin se plek waar jy gese het jy gaan saam met haar op n booking, ek kon sien jy het gehuiwer en jy het amper nie gegaan nie, en net voor jy gegaan het, het ek vir jou n boodskap gestuur:
            </br></br>

            Hier is n gedeelte van daai boodskap:
            <i style="font-size:14px">
            Dit is nou al maande wat ons elke dag alles saam doen, ek weet dit was nie altyd maklik nie, maar ons het nog elke keer n plan gemaak. Ek verstaan dat jy gestres is en dat jy miskien voel dat jy iets moet doen om geld te maak, en dat jy dalk voel dat jy nie n keuse het nie. Maar ek sal enige iets doen om nie weer daai uitdrukking op jou gesig te sien wat ek het n paar maande terug nie, dit het my hart gebreek en ek is nie seker of ek dit gaan kan vat om jou weer so te sien nie. Asb, as jy die boodskap kry, onthou dat ek hier is vir jou en dat jy nooit enige iets hoef te doen wat jy nie me gemaklik is nie, as jy die nou lees in die Uber opad soontoe dan is dit nog nie te laat nie, jy voel dalk dat dit nou sleg gaan met jou en dat jy nog nooit so swaar gekry het nie, maar as jy daaroor dink, dan is die, die beste wat dit met jou gegaan het, want geld is nie alles nie, die keuse saam met wie jy is en saam met wie jy gaan slaap en wie aan jou vat en wie jy aan vat is meer werd as enige hoeveelheid geld en dit is iets wat jy nou al vir maande lank besluit en jy het besluit om langs my te slaap, en my vas te hou  elke aand en dit beteken alles vir my, jy bly so spesiaal vir my en ek kry nou butterflies elke aand as ek net jou hand kan vas hou. Ek gee meer om vir jou as wat ek gedink het ek sal weer vir enige iemand kan voel. Asb kom terug! Jy is beter as daai werk en daai mense, jy is alles werd vir my ek wil jou so graag nou vas hou en seker maak niks gebeur met jou wat jy oor gaan spyt wees nie.
            </i>
            </br></br>
            Jy het terug gekom en die ander girls druk op jou geplaas het... Ek het jou vas gehou en ons het in mekaar se arms gehuil oor wat gebeur het, en ek weet jy was baie spyt oor wat jy gedoen het, ek weet nou dat jy geweet het wat gaan gebeur, maar jy dit was nie om my seer te maak nie, dit was ook nie net vi geld nie, maar om daai distance vir jouself te skep. Maar net soos toe verby was, was jy dadelik spyt en jy wou gehad het dat dit nooit gebeur het nie en dit het jou op gefok, ek weet dit het.

    <h3>Blame-Shifting to Protect Self-Worth</h3>

    <p>Blame-shifting is another protective habit. Instead of recognizing their own fear-driven behavior, a disorganized avoidant may <em>find fault in their partner or friend</em> as a way to justify pulling back.</p>

    <div class="example-container" id="example-blame-shifting">
        <div class="example-header">

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research">
            <p>One person with fearful-avoidant tendencies reflected, <em>"FA involves a lot of blame and unconscious projection. I would mostly assume it was the other person not being appropriately committed or intimate, and that's why I was feeling turmoil about commitment or intimacy... I just thought the other person was doing closeness wrong."</em> <a href="https://joyninja.com/fearful-avoidant-attachment-how-to-heal/#:~:text=,the%20other%20person%20is%20riddled" target="_blank"><sup>(The Hell that is Fearful-Avoidant Attachment (and How to Heal It) - Joy Ninja)</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>This candid admission shows how they might convince themselves that their partner is <em>too clingy, too demanding, or doing something "wrong"</em>, rather than acknowledging their own terror of closeness. By focusing on the partner's supposed flaws, they externalize the problem - <em>"I'm not uncomfortable with intimacy, <strong>you</strong> are just pushing me"</em> becomes the narrative <a href="https://joyninja.com/fearful-avoidant-attachment-how-to-heal/#:~:text=,the%20other%20person%20is%20riddled" target="_blank"><sup>(The Hell that is Fearful-Avoidant Attachment (and How to Heal It) - Joy Ninja)</sup></a>. One therapist notes that avoidant individuals often “deflect responsibility and attention from themselves and blame their partner” when intimacy issues arise <a href="https://www.couplesinstitute.com/intimacy-avoidance-comes-with-externalization-and-blame/?srsltid=AfmBOoqkR58zyo_cvI2YshCHUELR2UMNN7oH1ZBtFotTXY33uyvu3s_I#:~:text=Intimacy%20Avoidance%20Comes%20with%20Externalization,partner%20than%20it%20is" target="_blank"><sup>(Intimacy Avoidance Comes with Externalization and Blame)</sup></a>.</p>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal">
            <p>Nade consistently shifted blame onto Charl, especially after the final breakup. She adopted Hubert's narrative, accusing Charl of being "abusive" and a "psychopath." Charl notes, "now she's accusing me of always being abusive and that my reaction to her infidelity is the problem and not what she actually did." 
            </br></br>
            She focused entirely on his emotional reactions (calling names, hitting her once after extreme provocation and months of her own violence/betrayal) to paint him as the sole cause of the relationship's failure, thereby deflecting responsibility for her sustained dishonesty, infidelity, drug use, and violence.

    <h3>Creating Conflicts to Create Distance</h3>

    <p>When feeling too close, disorganized attachers may unconsciously create conflicts as a way to regain emotional distance.</p>

        <div class="example-header">

        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research">
            <p>A man described how his fearful-avoidant girlfriend <strong>began nitpicking and arguing over trivial things</strong> right when he was being most supportive of her. She even started <em>"switching opinions just to contradict mine"</em> - creating conflict out of nowhere <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/attachment_theory/comments/jau2fz/fearful_avoidant_and_self_sabotage/#:~:text=I%20,but%20progressive%20until%20it%20imploded" target="_blank"><sup>(Fearful avoidant and self sabotage)</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>He recalls her suddenly complaining about minor habits (like how he scratched plates while eating) and becoming increasingly stubborn and critical until the relationship blew up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/attachment_theory/comments/jau2fz/fearful_avoidant_and_self_sabotage/#:~:text=I%20,but%20progressive%20until%20it%20imploded" target="_blank"><sup>(Fearful avoidant and self sabotage)</sup></a>. At the end she explained the breakup by saying <em>"things were moving too fast"</em>, implying <strong>he</strong> was the problem for advancing the relationship <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/attachment_theory/comments/jau2fz/fearful_avoidant_and_self_sabotage/#:~:text=nitpicking%2C%20arguing%2C%20being%20over%20the,but%20progressive%20until%20it%20imploded" target="_blank"><sup>(Fearful avoidant and self sabotage)</sup></a>. In reality, it appears she <em>manufactured reasons to push him away</em>, because her fears were triggered by how good and helpful he was.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal">
            <p>During their final, escalating argument, Nade employed multiple tactics that created conflict and prevented resolution. Charl describes her talking over him, reading cigarette warnings instead of listening, mocking his request for clear communication ("talk with your heart, not your brain"), sending a dismissive WhatsApp message and then cutting off communication by turning off her phone. 
            </br></br>    
            She then escalated physically by pulling his computer screens and shouting "Hit me, hit me!" These actions served to derail any potential for constructive conversation and created intense conflict, ultimately leading to the physical altercation and breakup.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Gaslighting-Like Behavior (Often Unintentional)</h3>

    <p>In more extreme cases, this pattern can escalate to <strong>gaslighting-like behavior</strong>, though it's often unintentional. The avoidant's narrative about why the relationship isn't working may drastically differ from reality, leaving the other person doubting themselves.</p>

    <div class="example-container" id="example-unintentional-gaslighting">
        <div class="example-header">
            <h3 class="example-title">Example: Unintentional Reality Distortion</h3>

        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research">
            <p>A fearful-avoidant who is secretly struggling with feeling unlovable might accuse their partner <em>"You're going to leave me, I know it"</em> or <em>"You don't really care about me"</em>, when in fact the partner has been very present. These accusations are projections of the avoidant's inner fears.</p>

            <p>Conversely, they might claim the partner is "too demanding" or <em>"smothering"</em> to rationalize their own withdrawal, even if the partner was simply asking for basic communication. It's a form of <strong>emotional self-defense</strong> - by blaming the partner's behavior, the disorganized individual avoids confronting their own vulnerability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal">
            <p>Nade denied her earlier admission of sleeping with two clients throughout the year, claiming she couldn't remember saying it (possibly due to GHB). Charl recalls, "she forgot that she told me that she'd been sleeping with two clients all year." Additionally, her insistence that "we're not really together" despite their shared life and intimacy distorts the reality of their relationship to minimize her accountability.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Secretive Behaviors to Maintain Control</h3>

    <p>Lying can also occur in the context of <strong>secretive behaviors</strong> that help the avoidant maintain space. They may hide actions that they fear would upset their partner or force an intimate discussion.</p>

    <div class="example-container" id="example-hiding-information">
        <div class="example-header">
            <h3 class="example-title">Example: Withholding Information</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="tabs-wrapper">
            <button class="tab-btn" data-tab="research">Research Example</button>
            <button class="tab-btn" data-tab="personal">Personal Example</button>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research">
            <p>A fearful-avoidant might <em>lie about being in contact with an ex</em> or about how they spend their time, not necessarily to cheat but sometimes just to <em>preserve a sense of independence</em>. It's an avoidance strategy: if they don’t reveal it, they don’t have to face an emotional scene or their partner’s disappointment, both of which they are ill-equipped to handle.</p>

            <p>In one example, a woman did not tell her boyfriend how much she was talking to her ex, likely knowing it was inappropriate but also feeling compelled to keep that connection. When confronted post-breakup, she <em>downplayed it</em> ("we're just friends") and only under pressure admitted she had serious unresolved feelings <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Her%20text%20said%20that%20she%E2%80%99d,claimed%20she%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20pursing%20him" target="_blank"><sup>(For those who've been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps)</sup></a>. This kind of dishonesty is destructive to trust – the partner feels betrayed not only by the infidelity but by the constant deception.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal">
            <p>Nade frequently withheld information or lied by omission. Key examples include: lying about staying with a woman in the guesthouse (when it was a man she was sleeping with); not telling Charl she informed Erica she'd continue seeing clients after promising him she'd stop; lying about going shopping when she actually went to work at Erica's brothel for the weekend; and borrowing money from Ian again after Charl had given her money specifically to pay off clients and cut ties. 
            </br></br>    
            These secrets prevented Charl from understanding the true situation and protected her from confrontation.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Rationalization to Avoid Responsibility</h3>

    <p>Finally, we often see <strong>rationalization</strong> and <em>minimization</em> as part of deflection. Fearful-avoidants will make <em>rational sounding justifications</em> for why they pulled away or hurt someone.</p>

    <div class="example-container" id="example-rationalization">
        <div class="example-header">
            <h3 class="example-title">Example: Noble-Sounding Excuses</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="tabs-wrapper">
            <button class="tab-btn" data-tab="research">Research Example</button>
            <button class="tab-btn" data-tab="personal">Personal Example</button>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="research">
            <p>They might say, <em>"It wouldn't be fair to you if we stayed together while I'm confused,"</em> as one woman told her boyfriend when breaking up to chase an old flame <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zfpvr9/for_those_whove_been_dumped_by_someone_with/#:~:text=Her%20text%20said%20that%20she%E2%80%99d,claimed%20she%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20pursing%20him" target="_blank"><sup>(For those who've been dumped by someone with Disorganized/Fear-Avoidant Detachment, what was your experience in the months after the breakup? : r/BreakUps)</sup></a>. On the surface, that sounds considerate - she framed it as protecting him from her own confusion.</p>

            <p>But this was a rationalization that masked the deeper truth: she was terrified of committing fully to a healthy relationship and was escaping to a familiar but toxic situation. By saying <em>"it's not fair to you,"</em> she deflected from her own accountability in nurturing two attachments at once. Similarly, an avoidant might claim, “I needed space because I didn’t want to hurt you by fighting,” when in fact they were just overwhelmed by emotions. These explanations often have a kernel of truth but omit the core issue (their fear) and place the decision in a more palatable light. It’s easier for them to say “I did this for you” or “because of X external reason”, rather than, “I was scared and messed up.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" data-tab="personal">
            <p>When ending the relationship via WhatsApp during the final argument, Nade sent a message "basically dismissing our whole relationship" with the phrase "thanks for being on my journey." This framed the end not as a result of her actions (infidelity, dishonesty, returning to work against their agreement) but as a natural, almost philosophical conclusion to a 'journey.' 
            </br></br>    
            This rationalization allowed her to avoid accountability for the specific betrayals and conflicts that led to the breakup, making it seem like an impersonal, inevitable parting rather than a consequence of her choices.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Understanding the Underlying Pain</h3>

    <p>It's important to understand that these behaviors stem from deep pain and fear, not malice. Dishonesty and deflection serve as shields for the fearful-avoidant. They lie or omit information to avoid anticipated hurt or rejection. They externalize blame to protect their fragile self-worth and to make sense of their own pullbacks. Common <strong>trauma-driven motives</strong> behind these behaviors include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lying/omitting</strong> - motive: avoid potential conflict or rejection (if I tell the truth, you'll get mad or leave).</li>
        <li><strong>Blame-shifting</strong> - motive: protect a fragile self-worth (I can't be the problem because that would confirm I'm unlovable).</li>
        <li><strong>Creating conflict</strong> - motive: regain emotional distance when feeling too vulnerable (I need to push you away before you get too close and hurt me).</li>
        <li><strong>Rationalizing</strong> - motive: make sense of confusing behaviors driven by unconscious fear (I need a logical reason for why I'm pulling away).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Recognizing these patterns is essential for both disorganized attachers and their loved ones. While it doesn't excuse the pain these behaviors cause, understanding the source can be the first step toward healing and changing the pattern.</p>
