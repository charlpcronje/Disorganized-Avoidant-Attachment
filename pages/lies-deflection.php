        <h2>Lies, Deflection, and Blaming Loved Ones</h2>

        <p>To cope with their intense fear of intimacy and the shame they carry, disorganized avoidants often resort to <strong>dishonesty and deflection</strong>. Importantly, these are usually <em>reflexive, unconscious tactics</em> - not calculated manipulation. The person is often <em>not fully aware</em> that they are lying or shifting blame; they are instinctively trying to protect themselves from emotional discomfort or perceived danger. This can manifest as withholding information, making excuses, or even gaslighting-type behaviors (unintentionally) when confronted about their withdrawal or other hurtful actions.</p>

                <p>When a partner or friend senses something is wrong and asks about it - the fearful-avoidant will <em>deny their true feelings</em> and give a plausible external explanation. For example, when a boyfriend noticed his disorganized-attached girlfriend was distancing herself, she <strong>insisted nothing was wrong</strong>, blaming stress at work or feeling ill <sup>1</sup>.</p>

                <p>This was a deflection; in reality, she was emotionally shutting down out of fear, but by <em>shifting the focus to work</em> she avoided a vulnerable conversation about her anxiety. Disorganized individuals often become adept at such **excuse-making**. They might cancel plans citing a headache when actually they felt too emotionally close and panicked. They might say “I've just been busy” when they haven't answered texts, when in truth they were avoiding attachment triggers. These little lies are a way to maintain distance without directly confronting the issue.</p>

                <br>When I got to know you end of 2022 / beginning of 2023 until you were gone from Silverton. In those 5-6 months you only did two bookings. It's not that you had no bookings, but you were either late every time, or the client didn't show up, or something happened that the booking never happened. It also wasn't that I held you back. I don't know how many times I ran to the liquor store for you because you didn't want to see a client sober.
                </br></br>
                The two times you did go to a booking, it was both times with Ian. I obviously didn't know that at the time. I can't be sure about your first appointment with him, I actually don't believe that you thought it would go that far, because when you came back, it really looked like you weren't doing so well.
                </br></br>
                Then later we moved into the upstairs room, and we slept together for the first time. Then just a few days later you went to that appointment at your friend's place where you said you were going with her on a booking, I could see you hesitated and you almost didn't go, and just before you went, I sent you a message:
                </br></br>
            </talk>
            <talk voice="ash">
                Here is a part of that message:
                <i style="font-size:14px">
                It's already been months that we've done everything together every day, I know it wasn't always easy, but we still made a plan every time. I understand that you're stressed and that you may feel that you have to do something to make money, and that you may feel like you don't have a choice. But I will do anything not to see that expression on your face again that I saw a few months ago—it broke my heart and I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle seeing you like that again. Please, if you get this message, remember that I'm here for you and that you never have to do anything you're not comfortable with. If you're reading this now in the Uber on the way there, then it's still not too late. You might feel like it's going badly with you now and that you've never had it this hard before, but if you think about it, then this is the best things have gone for you, because money isn't everything—the choice of who you're with and who you sleep with and who touches you and who you touch is worth more than any amount of money, and that's something you've been deciding for months now. You've chosen to sleep next to me, and to hold me every night, and that means everything to me. You're so special to me and I get butterflies every night just from holding your hand. I care more about you than I thought I would ever be able to feel for anyone again. Please come back! You're better than that work and those people. You're worth everything to me. I want so badly to hold you now and make sure nothing happens to you that you're going to regret.

                You came back and the other girls had put pressure on you... I held you and we cried in each other's arms about what happened, and I know you were very sorry about what you did. I know now that you knew what was going to happen, but it wasn't to hurt me. It also wasn't just for money—but to create that distance for yourself. But just when it was over, you were immediately sorry and you wanted it never to have happened, and it messed you up. I know it did.

        <h3>Blame-Shifting to Protect Self-Worth</h3>

        <p>Blame-shifting is another protective habit. Instead of recognizing their own fear-driven behavior, a disorganized avoidant may <em>find fault in their partner or friend</em> as a way to justify pulling back.</p>

                <p>One person with fearful-avoidant tendencies reflected, <em>"FA involves a lot of blame and unconscious projection.

I just thought the other person was doing closeness wrong."</em></p>

                <p>This candid admission shows how they might convince themselves that their partner is <em>too clingy, too demanding, or doing something "wrong"</em>, rather than acknowledging their own terror of closeness.

                <p>Nade consistently shifted blame onto Charl, especially after the final breakup. She adopted Hubert's narrative, accusing Charl of being "abusive" and a "psychopath."

                <p>During their final, escalating argument, Nade employed multiple tactics that created conflict and prevented resolution. Charl describes her talking over him, reading cigarette warnings instead of listening, mocking his request for clear communication ("talk with your heart, not your brain"), sending a dismissive WhatsApp message and then cutting off communication by turning off her phone.
                </br></br>
                She then escalated physically by pulling his computer screens and shouting "Hit me, hit me!" These actions served to derail any potential for constructive conversation and created intense conflict, ultimately leading to the physical altercation and breakup.</p>

                <p>In one example, a woman did not tell her boyfriend how much she was talking to her ex, likely knowing it was inappropriate but also feeling compelled to keep that connection. When confronted post-breakup, she <em>downplayed it</em> ("we're just friends") and only under pressure admitted she had serious unresolved feelings. This kind of dishonesty is destructive to trust - the partner feels betrayed not only by the infidelity but by the constant deception.</p>

On the surface, that sounds considerate - she framed it as protecting him from her own confusion.</p>

                <p>But this was a rationalization that masked the deeper truth: she was terrified of committing fully to a healthy relationship and was escaping to a familiar but toxic situation. By saying <em>"it's not fair to you,"</em> she deflected from her own accountability in nurturing two attachments at once. Similarly, an avoidant might claim, “I needed space because I didn't want to hurt you by fighting,” when in fact they were just overwhelmed by emotions. These explanations often have a kernel of truth but omit the core issue (their fear) and place the decision in a more palatable light. It's easier for them to say “I did this for you” or “because of X external reason”, rather than, “I was scared and messed up.”</p>

        <h3>Understanding the Underlying Pain</h3>

        <p>It's important to understand that these behaviors stem from deep pain and fear, not malice. Dishonesty and deflection serve as shields for the fearful-avoidant. They lie or omit information to avoid anticipated hurt or rejection. They externalize blame to protect their fragile self-worth and to make sense of their own pullbacks. Common <strong>trauma-driven motives</strong> behind these behaviors include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lying/omitting</strong> - motive: avoid potential conflict or rejection (if I tell the truth, you'll get mad or leave).</li>
            <li><strong>Blame-shifting</strong> - motive: protect a fragile self-worth (I can't be the problem because that would confirm I'm unlovable).</li>
            <li><strong>Creating conflict</strong> - motive: regain emotional distance when feeling too vulnerable (I need to push you away before you get too close and hurt me).</li>
            <li><strong>Rationalizing</strong> - motive: make sense of confusing behaviors driven by unconscious fear (I need a logical reason for why I'm pulling away).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Recognizing these patterns is essential for both disorganized attachers and their loved ones. While it doesn't excuse the pain these behaviors cause, understanding the source can be the first step toward healing and changing the pattern.</p>
