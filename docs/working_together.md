# Collaborative Approach

## Initial Design Document
For any non-trivial task, I will begin by creating a brief design document. This will include:
- My understanding of the requirements
- The approach I plan to take
- A list of files that will be created or modified

## Task Breakdown
- Break down the implementation into specific, actionable tasks
- Estimate the complexity of each task
- Highlight any potential challenges, assumptions, or questions

## Review and Alignment
- You review the design document and task breakdown
- You may modify, add, or remove tasks as needed
- We align on expectations, priorities, and approach

## Implementation
- Iâ€™ll implement the solution based on the agreed-upon plan
- Provide progress updates at key milestones
- Communicate clearly if any unexpected issues arise

## Review and Iteration
- Conduct a final review of the implemented changes
- Make any necessary refinements or adjustments
- Document lessons learned for future reference

This structured approach is designed to:
- Improve efficiency and clarity
- Minimize frustration on both sides
- Empower you with visibility and control while enabling me to contribute meaningfully
